Mount RushmoreMount Rushmore is a national monument located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Carved into the side of thelarge mountain are the faces of four men who were United States presidents. These men were chosen because allfour played important roles in American history. The four faces carved onto Mount Rushmore are those of GeorgeWashington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Each face carved into the mountain isabout 60 feet tall.George Washington was chosen for this monument because of his role in the Revolutionary War and his fightfor American independence. He was the first United States president and is often called the father of our country.Thomas Jefferson was picked because he believed that people should be allowed to govern themselves, which is thebasis for democracy. Abraham Lincoln was added because he believed that all people are equal, and he helped endslavery in the United States. Theodore Roosevelt was chosen because he was such an influential president andworld leader.The man who carved Mount Rushmore was named Gutzon Borglum, and he worked on the monument until hisdeath in 1941. After Gutzon Borglum died, his son Lincoln Borglum worked on the mountain until there was nomoney left to continue. Fourteen years were spent creating the faces on Mount Rushmore. Dynamite was used toblast the tough granite rock off the mountain to make a smooth surface for the faces. George Washington wascarved first, and his face began as an egg-shaped piece of granite. Thomas Jefferson was added to the right ofGeorge Washington, but his face cracked and had to be blasted off the mountain. Jefferson was then re-carved to theleft of George Washington. Lincoln and then Roosevelt were added to the mountain. Snow and a dearth of moneyslowed down the work, and all work on the monument ended when there was no money left to continue.
