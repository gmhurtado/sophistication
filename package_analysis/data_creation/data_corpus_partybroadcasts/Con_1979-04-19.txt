19th April 1979

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Welcome to the international prosperity race run over five years. Look at these two fine runners Brown and Wood, representing Great Britain - full of talent, enthusiasm and raring to go.
And they're off. Brown's pulling ahead - oh what a joy it is to see this boy go. Wood isn't far behind. They're leading the field. A fine start for this British pair ... And what's happened here? Ah the British Labour party, managing this year's team, have decided it isn't fair on Wood if Brown leads, so they're actually going to handicap Brown with a large weight to give Wood a chance to catch up. What a weight - record taxation.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Since Labour came to power in 1974, the British working man has been weighed down by more and more tax. More direct taxes, like income tax. In fact more tax on almost everything you earn and much of what you buy.

OTHER ANONYMOUS VOICE:

More?

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Fact. No other major industrial country in the world extracts a higher rate of income tax from both its high and low paid citizens than the present Labour government.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

[The fellow?] he's gamely carrying on. But now Great Britain's other challenge is coming up on the inside. Oh what a runner this boy is, he's getting into his stride, he can't fail. [Oh look] here's the British Labour managers coming on once more. And now they're trying to stop Wood getting ahead. Can't they leave our boys alone? They've produced higher unemployment. Now what a weight this is round the neck of the British man.

ANOTHER MAN:

People say that the Labour party's the working man's party. But that's nonsense. Their policies of high taxation actually discourage people from working - sometimes stop them all together, so they end up on the dole queue.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

What a burden. But still they're fighting on. Brown is getting his second wind, they're neck and neck, but the British effort is [?] they're slowing down under the weight of this Labour government. It can't be long now before the French and Germans catch up, not to mention the Japanese who are coming fast on the outside lane. Our boys are really going to have to watch out for these foreign competitors. Hello, the British Labour managers are coming on again. Yes they must be there to take off some of the weights. No, no, no, they've got two more weights to [hold down?] the British team. Record inflation. They can't be serious.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Fact. Since Labour came to power we've had the worse peace-time inflation since the Great Plague, over three hundred years ago.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Britain is looking pretty sick now, I must say. France and Germany are now way ahead, and that little dot on the horizon is the Japanese team. The British team is doing badly, very badly indeed. We're giving this one away.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Why have we fallen so far behind? High taxation and high unemployment mean we make less goods than the Germans, the French and the Japanese. So we make less profits than the Germans, the French and the Japanese. So we invest less in new machinery than the Germans, the French and the Japanese. So the products we make on our old machinery cost more than the Germans, the French and the Japanese. So not only do we export less than the Germans, the French and the Japanese, but we buy more products from - you've guessed it - the Germans, the French and the Japanese. So we have less work ,which means a dole queue that would stretch from London to Inverness, and money that buys less than French money, German money and Japanese money. Poor Britain. Unless something is done it will be poorer and poorer Britain.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Why don't the Labour managers do something about it? Ah, well here they come. But they're weighed down by Labour's philosophy. What are they going to do to help encourage the British lads? I don't believe it, it's the old favourite, [?] controls. This really is bringing Britain down with managers like these who needs opponents?

ANONYMOUS MALE:

In the last few years, people in this country have had to put up with constant government controls. Instead of being allowed to press ahead at their own pace, the British people have had the Labour government interfering and holding them back. And because British production under Labour has been low, British wages under Labour have had to be low. Low production means low wages. Because Labour can't get production moving they have had to be more concerned with restricting wages, rather than increasing them.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Brown and Wood are almost collapsing under the weight of Labour's interference. There doesn't seem to be any incentive to go any faster even if they could. As soon as one of them gets ahead he's been pulled back - it's slowing the whole thing down. Oh no, no, Brown can't take any more, he's falling, he's down, dragging Britain's hopes with him. The Labour party's turned the British [?] race into an obstacle course. No, no, now what's happening here? The crowd, the crowd - they're calling for a change of management. But no, they're not going, they're hanging on, oh surely they've got to go. But who is going to take over?

ANONYMOUS MALE:

The real question at the next election is which part will the British choose to help get Britain moving, and production growing? Well, if they base their decision on the record, they'll choose the Conservatives. Fact. Since the war with Conservative governments production has increased by twice as much as under Labour.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

The Labour managers have [?] been sent in for an early bath. It's the Conservative managers coming on, they're heading straight for Brown and Wood, and yes they are taking off the weight of taxation.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Which party will the British people choose to cut their income tax? Well, if they base their decision on the record, they'll choose the Conservatives. Fact. In the last thirty years, every Labour government has increased income tax. Every Conservative government has cut income tax.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Our boys are now back on their feet and really making up for lost time. Now they're taking off another weight, they're giving them some incentive. This is most encouraging.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Which party will the British people choose to give us back our incentive to work and increase real take home pay? Well, if they base their decision on the record, they'll choose the Conservatives. Fact. Since the war, with the Conservatives, the average industrial worker's real take-home pay, has gone up nearly four and a half times more than under Labour.

ANOTHER (TORY?) MAN:

If you want to earn more, Labour don't seem to want you to. So they tax you, so it isn't worth your while. Labour will never give you the incentives. But we will.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Brown and Wood are really producing the results now. They're coming up fast and the chances are getting better. Without the dead weight of Labour government interference they can start to [?]

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Which party will the British people choose to tackle the unemployment problem? Well, if they base their decision on the record, it'll be the Conservatives. Fact. Twice since the war, nearly a million new jobs have been created with the Conservatives - something that has never happened during a Labour period of government.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Great Britain is now really back in the picture, they're doing better all the time. And look now they're throwing off another Labour burden, nothing can stop them now.

ANONYMOUS MALE:

Which party will the British people choose to help solve the inflation problem? Well, if they base their decision on the record, it'll be the Conservatives. Fact. Since the war there has been twice as much inflation under Labour.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

This really is a joy to watch. We're making up for the last five years. These boys are really motoring. I must say, it brings a lump to your [mouth?]

ANONYMOUS MALE:

The Conservatives always encourage success, ambition and reward. We've done it before; we'll do it again. How? It's not the impossible dream that it seems under Labour. We will give people back their ambitions and drive; make it possible for people to earn more so that they can buy more; so we can produce more; so we can make more profit; so we can invest in more machinery; so our goods cost less; so we export more; so we have more work; so we can buy more. The Conservatives believe that by freeing the people of too much taxation and too much government interference we will encourage everyone to make a better life for themselves and their families. And that means a better country.

MALE 'SPORTS COMMENTATOR':

Nothing can stop them now. This must be a British record. We're really giving the foreigners s run for their money. Oh what a difference this new government is making.

MARGARET THATCHER:

We've always had a sense of humour, and heaven knows we've needed it lately. But we've other characteristics too. A gift for invention, for initiative and for hard work. Under Labour, these talents are going to waste, because the government takes too much away in tax. How often do you hear people say 'Look how much they've taken from my pay packet'? So naturally we ask for bigger pay rises to make up the difference. And it's not long before that pushes up prices. Ask any housewife - she'll tell you. This government has increased prices more and faster than any other government since records were kept. The only way to keep prices down is to get production up, and you don't do that by weighing people down with taxes and other restrictions. They don't work for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, they work for their families. So we've got to cut the tax on earning and the tax on skill. Give our people incentives, and once again Britain will be back in the race.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Don't just hope for a better life; vote for one.
