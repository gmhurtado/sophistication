25th March 1992

VOICE:

March 1992. Labour are so keen to get into power that they have been making lots of promises. They would have to increase taxes far beyond the levels they have already admitted. They would have to hit the average tax payer with an extra one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds a year tax bill. Last week Labour's Mr Smith said that he wanted the biggest increase in taxes on incomes since the war. Labour also plan a minimum wage which would push up industry's costs, that means lost jobs and higher prices. So Labour would push up taxes and prices. And there's more - according to city forecasts Labour would have to push up interest rates by two and a half per cent, that would add forty pounds a month to the average mortgage. So Labour would push prices up, taxes up, and mortgages up. Could you face five years hard Labour? Could you pay one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds more tax a year?

WOMAN IN STREET:

If Labour do get in and my husband's taxes go up I mean it'll be devastating in our household.

FEMALE TEACHER:

If we do have a big increase in taxation then [inaudible] might have to think about selling the house.

VOICE:

Last time Labour were in power they taxed people so hard it hurt.

MAN:

If they increase income tax I can't think of a more direct disincentive to people not to work harder.

MAN 2:

Oh yes, I've no doubt at all that we'd have er much higher tax rates both business-wise and personally.

VOICE:

Could you get along with Labour's high prices?

MAN 3:

Prices would go up. I'm certain of that because taxes are going to go up, National Insurance contributions go up, people'll look for more money to pay for it, salaries go up - what happens then? - prices go up.

WOMAN:

Prices: hate to think that they will go sky high.

VOICE:

According to independent city analysts, Labour's plans would virtually double inflation.

MAN:

People paying more and more and more, for less and less and less.

VOICE:

How would you feel about forty pounds a month on your mortgage bill?

WOMAN:

Yeah, if Labour got in the taxes on my husband's wages - he had to pay more tax, it would cripple us with the mortgage.

VOICE:

So under Labour you're taxed more, you pay more, and your mortgage costs you more. Last time the only way people thought they could break out of it was through strikes, strikes, and more strikes. No wonder that eighty-six percent of businesses say that Labour would be bad for the economy. Of course this need not happen. The Conservatives have cut taxes. The basic rate is lower than at any time since the war and they're still going down, so the incentive is there and because the Conservatives have the determination to keep prices down Britain has lower inflation than even Germany, and because the Conservatives have cut inflation interest rates are now down taking eighty pounds a month off the average mortgage, and because the Conservatives have broken the grip of the unions strikes are down to the lowest level for a hundred years. Even through an international slow-down Britain's share of world trade has steadily grown. No wonder Japanese and American companies invest more money in Britain than in any other country in Europe. For Britain to grow when the world economy bounces back the last thing we need is five years hard labour.
