8th June 1987

THATCHER:

Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith and where there is despair, may we bring hope.

WOMAN SINGING:

Then one of us will be a queen and sit on a golden throne
With a crown instead of a hat on her head and diamonds all her own
With a beautiful robe of gold and green I've always understood
I wonder whether she'll wear a feather I rather think she should

CHORUS SINGING:

Oh `tis a glorious thing I mean to be a regular royal queen

MAN SINGING:

She'll drive about in a carriage and pair with a king on her left hand side
And a milk white horse as a matter of course whenever she wants to ride

WOMAN SINGING:

Whenever she condescends to walk be sure she'll sign at that
With a haughty stare and her nose in the air like a well born aristocrat

MAN SINGING:

And noble lords will scrape and bow and double themselves in two
And open their eyes in blank surprise at whatever she likes to do
And everybody will roundly bow she's fair as flowers in May
And say how clever at whatsoever she condescends to say

CHORUS SINGING:

Oh `tis a glorious thing I mean to be a regular royal queen

KINNOCK:

Waste, waste has been the most important feature of the last eight years. The waste of resources which has been huge - all that oil money all the other revenues that have poured in to the government, all of the capital they've allowed to pour out of the country - but most important of all the waste of people, the waste of talent, the failure to discover abilities because the education service has been kept back, the failure to nourish abilities, because of that the waste of youngsters who have no future to look forward to other than cover-up training schemes and the dole.

KINNOCK SPEECH:

I was in a home today in Middlesborough with a family a decent family proud of their kids proud of their home a hard working family when they'd got a chance to do any work there was the grandmother and the grandfather there who'd made their contribution what they had to live on is the old age pension there's a man and wife there a mother and father in their fifties he's been out of work for seven years and at fifty seven years of age has decided he's joined the retired they've got fifty three pounds a week to live on to pay all their bills except the rent and there's a boy there a young man nineteen years of age who's had six months of real solid work since he left school at sixteen

KINNOCK:

Oh I'm ready. I'm ready to lead our country. I'm ready because I know that I've got a team that's ready. I've got people of immense talent, immense ability who will make the commitment, work twenty five hours a day for their country and do it in the most sensitive but the most progressive and determined way.

JOHN SMITH:

Well the first and most important thing we're going to do is to reduce unemployment by one million in the first two years of a Labour government. Now we know it can be done and the only question the Tories are asking is can it be afforded. Of course it can be afforded. We're wasting twenty billion pounds every year in this country on paying people not to work. We want to pay a modest amount to get people back to work.

ROY HATTERSLEY:

I'm going to ask the people, the top five percent, the richest people in our community to help the pensioners, to help the families, to help the unemployed. I think that is the right thing for a decent government to do.

KINNOCK:

I think that when the history of the last eight years is looked at the word that covers it most is fear, not freedom, fear. Fear of going out, fear of being in certain areas, fear of losing a job, fear of speaking out in many ways, and not dramatising it or overstating it it is the case now that around this country of ours there are more people more anxious, more fearful, more inhibited than there were eight years ago. There are long and complex ways for me to say how I feel about my country but stripped down I think it's probably as basic as this: my country is my family and just as I wouldn't allow anybody to lay a finger on my family, so I wouldn't allow anybody to lay a finger on my country.

HEALEY:

Whatever you thought about nuclear weapons twenty years years ago er there are fifty thousand nuclear weapons - that's a million Hiroshimas in the world. If they ever go off it's curtains for the human race north of the equator and everybody agrees about that.

KINNOCK:

How do we gain security from the prospect of such a terrible ruin, that irrecoverable ruin? And the answer must be as president Reagan has said, as Mikail Gorbachev has said, the removal of the weapons. Now I think they've got a lot of courage, a lot of foresight, a lot of audacity to offer that agenda and even more to actively pursue it. It really does take immense strength in order to do that they are [inaudible].

KINNOCK SPEECH:

Individual liberty depends upon collective contribution. The welfare of each of us is the responsibility of all of us. That is what is so fundamentally wrong about Margaret Thatcher's vision of a Britain in which personal security depends entirely upon private affluence. That is what is so narrow and short-sighted about her yearning for a country in which access to essential services depends upon the ability to pay and not upon the need for health.

KINNOCK:

At constituency level, on the streets, in the towns everybody is marching to the same drum-beat, everybody's heart is beating to the same pulse, and that gives an immense feeling of confidence and capability. I think we can do that for the country not just for a party. It's a choice between having a United Kingdom with all that that means in terms of working together, and being a divided kingdom that's being pulled apart. And because people know that they're faced with those choices they want a positive result, they want the United Kingdom, they want the modern welfare state, they want Britain to be a making economy that can sell, compete, and they know that to achieve those things they need a government that is with that [inaudible] and that's a Labour government.
