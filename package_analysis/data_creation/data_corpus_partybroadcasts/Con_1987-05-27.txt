27th May 1987

TORY MAN (!):

You've just seen the new Labour party of Neil Kinnock: glossy brochures, glossy words, glossy images. It all looks very comfortable and cosy, doesn't it? But when you look behind all the rosy covers what do you find?

VOICE:

This is Valerie Vaness, Labour candidate for Nuneaton.

ACTOR ONE:

A Labour government has got to take on the people who obstruct it, arresting them if necessary, arm the workers if necessary.

VOICE:

Pat Wall, Labour candidate for Bradford North.

ACTOR TWO:

The working class needs an entirely different kind of state, a workers' state based upon councils of workers' delegates and a workers' militia.

VOICE:

Bernie Grant, Labour candidate for Haringey talking about the Tottenham riots.

ACTOR THREE:

The police got a bloody good hiding.

VOICE:

Ken Livingstone, Labour candidate for Brent East and former leader of the GLC.

ACTOR FOUR:

I'm not in favour of the army, I'm in favour of replacing it with armed workers' brigades to defend the factories.

VOICE OVER:

Diane Abbot, Labour candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington.

ACTOR FIVE:

All white people are racist.

VOICE:

And this is Neil Kinnock.

ACTOR SIX:

I am deeply antagonistic to militant. I want them out of the Labour party. We shall act very toughly.

TORY MAN:

So what very tough action against the hard left has Neil Kinnock taken? Well, he endorsed all the people you just heard as official Labour candidates, and that is by no means all of them.

VOICE:

One hundred and one of the official Labour candidates in the election have been identified by the alliance as belonging to the hard left. Amongst them are candidates who have either contributed to militant tendency's funds or have supported militant's right to be in the Labour party. Militant tendency's declared aim is to forward the revolutionary class struggle. Even the Guardian has published a report showing that nearly sixty percent of the parliamentary Labour party next time could be from the left of the party. And Ken Livingstone who only came to power in the GLC by overthrowing the moderate elected Labour leader exactly twenty four hours after the election said:

ACTOR FOUR:

The new intake will represent the most radical bunch of MPs the party has ever had. They will change the whole centre of balance in the Labour party.

TORY MAN:

So watch out Mr Kinnock. The truth is that behind all their new-found gloss the Labour party is more extreme and left-wing, less like the traditional Labour party than at any time in its history. Would that really make any difference if they ever got into power? Well don't let me answer that. You only have to see what happened where the new Labour party have had a taste of power in local government.

VOICE:

The Inner London Education authority. This Labour controlled authority has on its suggested reading list for schools "Young, gay and proud", "The play book for kids about sex", "Black lesbian in white America". Camden. This Labour council decided to sell off its street lamps, library books and parking meters. It's costing their rate payers a small fortune because Camden has now to pay rent in order to use them. Leeds. People in a Labour controlled Leeds nursery school decided Biggles books were biased because they advocate loyalty to the crown. Brighton. Richard Stanton, Labour chairman of Brighton council's finance committee talking about the Grand Hotel bombing:

ACTOR:

A justified political act.

TORY MAN:

That's the new rosy Labour party in Local government. Now if you need more proof of the left wing thorns behind the rose look at the Labour manifesto itself. The hard left policies that lurk beneath the glossy cover.

VOICE:

Law and order. They would relegalise secondary picketing which led to scenes like this. And they would politicise the police by bringing them under the control of local politicians. Terrorism. Labour is committed to repeal the prevention of terrorism act at a time when it's never been needed more. Nationalisation. Oblivious to the fact that ninety nine percent of British Gas workers took up the offer of shares in the company they worked for. They will re-nationalise British Gas and British Telecom and force more companies into state control. Defence. At a time when Russian nuclear capacity is at its highest ever they will reverse the policy of every Labour government since the war who supported Britain's nuclear defence. They will scrap our Polaris missiles, cancel our Trident missiles, remove all cruise missiles, and insist the Americans remove all their nuclear bases from British soil, abandoning the very policy that has given Europe the longest period of peace in her history.

TORY MAN:

So this is the new so-called moderate militant free Labour party. Behind the new glossy covers the red flag is still flying at home and the white flag abroad. The left is now dominant in the Labour party in a way it probably never has been. Well you might expect me to say that but I didn't - it was Peter Hayne, the official Labour candidate for Putney. So if you're even considering voting Labour I would ask you to consider first whether you really want people like this to represent you.

VOICE:

Jeremy Corbin, Labour candidate for Islington North:

ACTOR:

Defeat of the Tory government will be brought about by a series of disputes of which parliament is only a part.

VOICE:

Pat Wall, Labour candidate for Bradford North:

ACTOR:

A Marxist Labour government would mean the abolition of the monarchy, the house of lords, the sacking of the generals, the admirals, the air marshals, the senior civil servants, the police chiefs and in particular the judges.

VOICE:

Ken Livingstone Labour candidate for Brent East and former leader of the GLC:

ACTOR:

The rank and file of the Labour party which has been quite cautious in what it says over the last few months as we approach the election will be given a renewed vigour and actually more progressive.

TORY MAN:

Don't let the left run Britain. On June the eleventh vote Conservative.
