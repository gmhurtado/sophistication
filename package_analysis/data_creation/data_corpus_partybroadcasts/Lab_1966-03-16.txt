16th March 1966

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

In the studio live tonight are three journalists from national newspapers. They are Trevor Evans of the Daily Express, John Bourne of the Financial Times and Alan Watkins of the Spectator. They are free to put any questions they wish to the Minister of Labour, the Right Honourable Ray Gunter.

TREVOR EVANS:

Mr Gunter, one of the main claims of the Labour party is that it has shown how it can govern. But has it yet evoked a response from the nation? Now I ask this because a few hours ago the Department of Economic Affairs issued the latest index of industrial production which, for January of this year, was a hundred and thirty three - precisely what it was in January of 1965, but I think I should add that since the last general election there was an increase of nearly four per cent in production, but it happened in the first three months of your government, but it happened in the first three months of your government, but that there appears to have been stagnation during the past year. Why?

RT. HON. RAY GUNTER:

I think it's quite true that the government has governed and there have been responses from the nation, particularly industry. But, as I have said before, that response has not been large enough. It has not been quick enough. And I emphasise here that we are faced here with fundamental problems of increasing our production and of holding our consuming power in line with that production. In other words, that we may become an honest nation, and get out of debt. This can only be done by stern measures. Indeed, by hard government, and the response, I hope, will be more freely given in the future where restrictive practices, restrictive arrangements, bad management, will really come to terms with what is the fundamental problem of this nation - to earn an honest living by increasing its production.

JOHN BOURNE:

Minister, I think this leads on to the related point, that the most important, vital thing for the economy is to bring productivity up to the rate which wage earnings [increasing] recently. Now how precisely would a Labour government set about increasing the rate of productivity?

RAY GUNTER:

One of the first tasks - and we have tried very hard indeed, with some success over twelve months - is to get away from any practices or arrangements in industry that restrict production. It must be remembered, of course, that certain practices in industry, formulated years ago, were created because men were afraid of their jobs. They were afraid that they'd work themselves out of those jobs. We have to come to terms with many of those practices and those arrangements. You ask me what a Labour government would do. We are already doing our best and getting the response. Many of our trade union friends, with the management, are now entering into good agreements, productivity agreements, and we are on the move. But the speed is not sufficient to satisfy any government.

ALAN WATKINS:

Mr Gunter, isn't the reason why the speed is not sufficient that the present government has set up this Royal Commission? Now, why did you have to set up a Royal Commission on the trade unions? The government contains you, it contains Mr Brown, it contains Mr Cousins - all very eminent trade unions. There's your department, there's Mr George Woodcock. Surely you could have got all the information you wanted in a matter of months, instead of delaying another two years I believe before the Royal Commission reports? What is the point of this Royal Commission?

RAY GUNTER:

I fear you've over-simplified the issue, and, indeed, have a basic misunderstanding of what the Royal Commission is about. It's over sixty years ago since a Royal Commission had a look at the powers, the functions, the responsibilities of the trade unions in society. It happened at a time when the trade unions were weak. Things have changed. We live in a new world. The trade unions have great power. Two or three years ago, two years ago, it was found by their Lordships in the House of Lords, the judges there, that what we had thought had been the law - which was largely formulated sixty years ago - was to be interpreted in a different way. There was confusion even amongst the learned judges. Therefore, it was clear that a government who wanted to come to terms with the problems that arise from the place and purpose and power of trade unions, and employers' associations, in society, wanted to have a complete review of the whole of the facets of industrial relations and industry, not only the law as it should be laid down to define the power and responsibility but indeed a survey of what flowed from it in terms of the closure, restrictive practices and a host of other facets of industrial relations. Therefore it was right that eminent lawyers, men of industry, should calmly survey the whole scene and give us guidelines as to what should be the law in the future. It is surely beyond doubt that had the Conservative party, two years ago, seized the opportunity when that famous legal case was fought out where the confusion was highlighted, then the Royal Commission had been established we should now have had the results and we should have been in legislate in the present circumstances

TEVOR EVANS:

Now there's one other aspect of this business of response from the nation, Mr Gunter. Unemployment, happily, has remained fairly low but we have heard economists urge that if we had more unemployed people might be more ready to work. But Mr Callaghan said a very interesting thing yesterday. He said he didn't want any more unemployment but he would like more production from those in employment. Now, have you the feeling that there's some over-manning, or that some employers are holding too many workers, or that there's too much anxiety to have overtime without any regard to the cost of the product? Is there some cheating, as it were, going on in industry?

RAY GUNTER:

On the first point that you make, no-one wants unemployment. Those of us who saw it and suffered from it, we don't want it. But it is absolutely true - this is one of our major problems - that there is overmanning in certain industries, that we ought to have on the pay-rolls more men that are required to do or produce at a certain rate. And this is the problem of how to get men out, particularly out of contracting industries. This is why the government has given emphasis to re-training; given emphasis to redundancy payments, so that men may be conditioned to come out as the new machines pour in, and as it can be seen that the labour costs are too high, they can come out and be re-trained for other jobs and other crafts. I accept it immediately. There is over-manning. That is why we are trying to get unions and employers together to arrive at just and humane agreements that we can reduce in those industries that are over-manned and, at the same time, increase in what you might call the science-based industries - the new industries - the trained men that may come out of the over-manned industries.

JOHN BOURNE:

But Minister this all comes back, surely, to this question of productivity and how you get it up. Now one of the few places of the Labour manifesto where they are specific on this subject is where it says that there's going to be a productivity conference, chaired by the Prime Minister; then there are going to be pay and productivity councils. Well, now how are these things going to work? How are they going to be prevented from being what they've so often been before, this sort of body talking shop?

RAY GUNTER:

The Prime Minister has said that he would like a national conference, comprised from the leaders of the trade unions, so that he might outline his thoughts of how down the line, throughout industry, we may have these productivity councils, which are related to pay, which can be related to pay. In other words the effort is to be, and this leads me to the point that I am sure is at the back of your mind, how we can get a greater measure of co-operation with industry itself between the employer and the men so that wages can be related to increased productivity, so that we may eliminate those practices that are deterring our production. This is what's at the back of our mind and we want a great urgent drive throughout industry to do it.

ALAN WATKINS:

We've just heard, Minister, on the television, that one of the so-called kangaroo trials was not as serious as it was supposed to be. But this investigation has been carried out by unions. Now, with great respect, you seem to have been standing on the sidelines whilst deploring the reports that they're true. When do you, or your ministry, of the Ministry of Labour come into this and what is likely to be the outcome do you think?

RAY GUNTER:

I don't know exactly what you mean by standing on the sidelines. I thought it was the basic fact of British justice that before you came to conclusions you ascertained the facts.

ALAN WATKINS:

Now, may I interject here? What I mean is that the Ministry of Labour might have made the enquiry rather than leaving it to the unions concerned who might be considered bias.

RAY GUNTER:

If I may say, Mr Watkins, this is a revelation of inexperience in how industry works. I immediately demanded that the trade union leaders should meet me, that they should conduct their enquiry in what was alleged to be the misconduct of their own members. I understand now, this night as I left the ministry, that the facts do not appear, or would not seem to be quite as have been published in the press. I understand that in view of the investigation that has been made by the unions the matter is now to be referred to the Press Council, so that they may have a look at the facts that may emerge. I haven't stood on the sidelines. All I've wanted to do in justice to the trade unions was that the facts might be known before we arrive at conclusions.

JOHN BOURNE:

Minister, on this point and getting away from that particular dispute, in a recent statement, since the election campaign started, you said, and I quote here, 'the state must protect individuals against the tyranny of employers and trade unions', and then you went on to say that this could mean labour courts and possibly new legislation. Now how could these courts and this legislation work? How would they work?

RAY GUNTER:

I was speaking of legislation of a basic character. To clarify what is now in confusion as to the rights, responsibilities, duties of employers' associations and trade unions within society itself. But I allowed myself to think aloud, and rightly so. I believe that we may emerge, when we can get the law right, to a state where industrial courts may be established, where amongst other things disputes of a local character may be referred to for immediate arbitration, where indeed the trade unionist who has to make a protest, who has a legitimate complaint against his union, can take it there, that we have courts that can sit immediately in justice. If I may say I don't want these to be solely composed of lawyers because you know in industry there is far more than the letter of the law. It is the interpretation of the spirit.

TREVOR EVANS:

Minister, I must say that, from what you're saying, there is a threat - or at least a promise, as you look at it - of interference by the state in to the normal legislative processes of industry, or are you still going to rely, to some extent, on the continuation of voluntarism, in spite of its short-comings?

RAY GUNTER:

I am fundamentally convinced that free negotiations, with a minimum of government interference in industrial relations, is the right course. It must be, because we all know round this table industrial relations are human relations and all the laws in this world will never remove the old [...] from men who want to be responsible. What I have endeavoured, through my ministry and my colleagues, is to try and bring both sides together so that a better spirit may be created. Let us have better personnel managers. Let us have well-led trade unions and then let the spirit develop where production is the great objective. Not production for the sake of production, but that men's standards of life may be improved.

TREVOR EVANS:

And what you want is a national revolution in attitudes.

RAY GUNTER:

It is indeed. I believe that this nation is almost on the edge of this. I have the impression over this last twelve months, in industry, and my activities are closely confined to industry, that there is a growing willingness and understanding on the part of employers, and of the trade unions, that the nonsense must stop and we must get together. But it must always be remembered it is not a matter of the law it is a matter of attitudes. How man reacts to man. And how he conducts himself at his place of employment. That is what it is. I repeat, it is a matter of the spirit more than the letter of the law.
