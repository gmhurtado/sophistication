26th September 1964

Sir ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME:

In nineteen days from now we come to polling day in the general election in which thirty six million people have the opportunity to vote in a secret ballot. There will be immense issues at stake and there are momentous choices to be made. If I have to select two which transcend all others, I think the first is the security of Britain and the authority of Britain in international affairs. Every recent event has underlined that this is still a dangerous world and emphasised the wisdom of a defence and foreign policy which is based on strength and conciliation and what is more this foreign policy has shown results in the past. We have come through the cold war with our island secure. There is markedly less tension between the Soviet Union and the West and there we have achieved an act of enormous significance to mankind and that is the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on which we hope to build. Now it is at this time of all times when the Socialist Party come forward with a proposal to abandon all control by the British government over Britain's nuclear arm. I want you to have no doubts of the consequences of such a decision. It would, of course, remove us at once from the highest Councils of the world when the countries are discussing international affairs and peace and war in a nuclear age. These would be left to Russia and the United States. But for the first time in our history such an act would mean that decisions about the future and the life of Britain would be put into the hands of another nation. Now that I will never do and I want you to know it now.
The second issue is this. To-day we have full employment and prosperity in the sense that the standard of living is better than it ever was before. Now these are not matters of political argument, they are facts which everyone can verify inside their home and not very far outside too. And we in the Conservative Party have great ambitious programmes of development and modernisation and they all have one objective and that is by the sum of the success of countless individuals, to build a community in which to-morrow is always better than to-day. Now that's what I've called prosperity with a purpose and the purpose is wider opportunity and happier days for all our people. Now every individual has his own problems and there are local problems too. But I do ask you to think most seriously about these great themes and these great issues , for on your decision on these hangs the fate of our nation.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Scotland, the new Forth Bridge, a magnificent feat of engineering, pointing the way to a new industrial future for Scotland. My task as Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development is to help bring this about. Already we've offered sixty-two million pounds for the expansion of industry and for setting up new industry in Scotland. This includes Rootes of Linwood, the B.M.C. at Bathgate and a good many other factories for new industries in Scotland.
Well I am on the bankside of a firm of [-] and flour millers.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Naturally we buy into the thousands of tons of grain from the Lothians and the Borders and the opening of the Bridge has definitely helped us with speeding up lorries and deliveries are much quicker.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Well, I've been driving for approximately twenty years and the last twenty years there's been a vast improvement as far as my job's concerned being a driver. The new roads and the bridges have brought new industry, more jobs for Scotland. I think the government deserves the credit for this transformation that's brought Scotland to the forefront now.

EDWARD HEATH:

Now let us look at the North-East of England. There shipbuilding is going ahead, chemicals are expanding, there are to be two new refineries, a new industrial estate on the Tees, a new town at Washington. All over the area factories are springing up, a good many of them with government help.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Well, I am a North Easterner born and bred and it gives me a good deal of pleasure to see this factory giving work to these people in the north-east and I've seen in the last two years a good deal of improvement where other heavy industries have come and it has provided a lot of work in the heavy engineering district and the Board of Trade have been very very helpful and when one thinks that from the eleven months that this factory was started we occupied it and were in production, this can only give credit to the builders and everyone else and the organisation behind it from the Board of Trade.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Oh, yes, when the shipbuilding closed down, of course that was it and for a while there was nothing doing and then of course the trading estates they come in, Siemens and other people - then the steel works they had a bad run for a while and now they're back in full production so they're all right.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

I've seen a lot of changes - new schools, new factories and hospitals and the health service - you know, maternity hospitals, they're really wonderful and I came back here when I was twenty-two for a holiday and met Teddy and we got married. I wouldn't like to live anywhere else but West Hartlepool.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

There's factories going up all over the place. I came here when I was six year old and I wouldn't move for - if they'd give me a pension to-morrow, tell you the truth - I'm quite satisfied

EDWARD HEATH:

We've concentrated particularly on Central Scotland and North-East England because these are the areas which are changing most where the older industries are being replaced by the newer ones. We were also tackling the other main areas of the country. South Wales is already a great success story with a wide variety of new industries. On Merseyside the motor industry has gone in, Fords and Vauxhalls, in Northern Ireland there's Courtaulds, Duponts and another large number of new industries. Then in the South-East we've produced our proposals for dealing with he increase of population there. The Labour Party wanted us to hold these up. That would have been a body blow at the re-housing of Londoners and other people in the south-east and so we are combining these regional programmes with the great national ones. More houses, more schools, hospitals, roads, docks and airports and these are essential if we are going to increase our production and expand our exports and that is vital for the future of our country. We want this widening prosperity to be shared by all areas of the country. All these programmes to-day are going ahead faster than ever before and everyone knows it.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

I was born in Liverpool and I must say over the last five or six years I've seen a great improvement in general in the town re-building, re-housing in particular, a general cleaning up of the place, slum clearance down the town and I think it's a very nice thing to see as well. I'm very interested when I go round these new estates and the lay-out of them, they're obviously not cramping them together too much. One thing that interests me particularly I'm very glad to see, is this prefabrication, there's only a start made on it yet, but it is a start.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

I'm a farm manager here in Tetbury in Gloucestershire and I've been in Gloucestershire all my life in the farming community and I think there's wonderful opportunities for farming and any other young school leavers to-day.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Well I've lived here in Reading all my life. I bought this shop six years ago and I've got on very well, it's a very prosperous town this. All the factories here are a great help to me, full labour and no shortage of work and the housing going ahead like wildfires - a grand place to live in, very prosperous.

REGINALD MAUDLING:

So it is the same tale of progress up and down the length of the country. As Chancellor I'm especially glad to see the progress being made in areas like Scotland, for example, or the North-East where unemployment is above the national average. Because this means that the special measure of the 1963 Budget are having a very real effect and we are achieving our objective which is to ensure that economic growth and prosperity is more evenly spread throughout the country. Now take another example, not this time a large industrial city but a busy and thriving country town. King's Lynn.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

King's Lynn in Norfolk is typical of the new bustling and growing Britain. A busy and up-to-date port serving the agriculture and the new industries of East Anglia. Crowded on market days, more trade, more to spend, more to buy. For the British house-wife prices compare well with anywhere in Europe. There is a great improvement in this last - what - three or four years and I think there will be even greater opportunities in a few more years because after all industry is coming this way. As you probably know we have a trading estate in King's Lynn and it's expanding all the time.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

There's more people coming to King's Lynn - coming to stay to live here. There's more light industry. There's a great number of schools being built, not only in King's Lynn itself but in the area.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Well I do work in a Canning factory locally and as regards nationalisation, my one regret is if nationalisation of steel especially could affect well say affect my job and perhaps hundreds of others as well. Being in a canning factory there is that thing to remember.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Nationalisation - it's old-fashioned and out of date but the Labour Party are committed to it. Steel is the basis of over half our exports. Our steel industry is among the most modern in the world. There are over two hundred and fifty companies specialising in different products. It's part of all our lives - suspension bridges - for screws, everyone, every day handles steel.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

Conservatives believe that choice and competition guarantee the best steel for the housewife - the Labour Party say they will introduce planning every aspect of our life. Their policy is nationalisation and ever spreading State control. If the Labour Government were to nationalise things I feel that we would have to pay more taxes.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

I think nationalisation is the enemy of any private enterprise or free society.

SPEAKER NOT KNOWN:

As a housewife I feel at the moment life is pretty good. But with nationalisation I feel that the money has to come from somewhere and it's always the housewife, it hits her first.

REGINALD MAUDLING:

No, nationalisation is no answer to our problems and nor are the other traditional Labour Party ideas, like bulk buy(?) or more State control or widespread subsidies. Our greatest problem, and as Chancellor I know that it is a real and urgent one, our greatest problem is to secure a new and vigorous growth of our export trade. It can be done of that I have no doubt but it will call for great efforts from all of us. Efforts to sweep away any restrictive practices of labour or capital that place unnecessary limits on growth or efficiency. Efforts to increase competition, efforts to accept change and a grasp of new methods. Efforts in particular to agree as a nation on an incomes policy - a policy by which incomes continue to rise but not so fast that they push prices.
