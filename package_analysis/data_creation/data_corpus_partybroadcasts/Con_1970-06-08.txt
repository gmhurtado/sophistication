8th June 1970

VOICE OVER:

Do you recognise this? It is a frozen wage packet. Mr Wilson put it on the market in 1966. Vote Labour on June the eighteenth and you'll get it again: in the family size.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

To freeze or not to freeze - that is the question, the question Mr Wilson seems determined not to answer. Just what he is keeping from us and what he is keeping under the carpet is the topic of tonight's edition of A Better Tomorrow.

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

Mr Wilson talks about how Britain is strong, like a doctor who has examined the patient and found, to his surprise that he is still breathing. But perhaps "doctor" is not Mr Wilson's favourite word just now.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

I doubt whether he'd prefer bank manager, though since it was an ex-bank manager Lord Cromer, a former Governor of the Bank of England, who publicly put Mr Wilson in the red when he said, "I think there is no question that any government that comes into power after this next election is going to find a very much more difficult financial situation than the new government found in 1964".

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

But Lord Cromer's opinion, it appears isn't good enough. Well then Mr Wilson saw five hundred thousand who said "I agree entirely with Lord Cromer but if you are fighting an election it isn't really a popular thing to go along telling people grim home truths the whole time".

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

In fact, it was Lord Kearton, the Chairman of Courtaulds and a well known Labour supporter. And who said that the country was living through a period of extreme economic peril? A well known Conservative?

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

Mr Richard Crossman, a Labour Minister. It was his excuse for not giving the doctors their pay award. He later denied he had said it, or withdrew it if he had said it.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

It would appear we are not strong enough to give the doctors a tonic but Mr Crossman wasn't the only one to get his lines wrong. Mr Callaghan, and Mr Woodrow Wyatt, both gave broad hints that a new Labour government would mean a new wage freeze to which Mr Wilson said:

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

Nothing. It doesn't quite add up. Isn't it at least possible that the newspaper men have threatened to strike before the election because they know they have got a fat chance of getting an increase after the election?

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

Rubbish, Mr Wilson replied. Just look at our balance of payments. Well, let's look at them. We hear a lot about five hundred million pounds surplus; what we don't hear so much about is the one billion six hundred million pounds we now awe to foreign bankers. Alien bankers according to Mr Wilson. That is one hundred pounds a family.

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

The simple fact of the matter is that any Chancellor of the Exchequer can create a surplus if he is prepared to devalue, stop us spending, tax us viciously and deliberately keep a fair number of people permanently out of work. And that is precisely what has happened. Remember the 1966 election. Before the election Labour told us that the balance of payments was fine and it was sunshine all the way.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

After the election taxes were increased and wages were frozen. That is life under Labour. Four years freeze: four months sunshine. Now right now you may have a few bob in your pocket but ask your wife what is happening to prices in the High Street. Or do what we did and ask someone in the high street who is affected first - the family grocer. We asked him what had happened to prices in the last week.

GROCER:

Prices? There is margarine; there's coffee - there's your sausages - ice-cream of course, this affects the children; your soup; your pickles; a whole range of cakes; and your tea; and also tea bags. So it makes up quite a considerable list of these basic items alone. Some of them of course you shouldn't support them. Many of them - it is not a case of going up a penny just here and there but it is a big jump and it does happen and some of these items like margarine are up for the second time in a short period.

CHATAWAY:

The other day Mr Heath spoke of the first frost before the freeze: It could well be a long cold winter.
We'll be back in a moment.

VOICE OVER:

Since Mr Wilson came to power this is what he has done to your pound. Going at the same rate 1971 would be like this - fourteen shillings and three; 1972 - thirteen and a penny; 1973 - twelve shillings; 1974 - eleven shillings; 1975 - ten shillings. The ten bob pound - only your vote can stop it.
Well - are you going to freeze wages or not? Why don't you pay doctors ? What are you going to do about Wedgewood Benn? That about the economic ...? Are we skint or aren't we?

But from Mr Wilson, all we hear is the deafening sound of silence. He didn't answer last week's questions; will he answer this week's questions?

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

Welcome back. In a moment we'll hear from Mr Iain Macleod; but first let's see how that long suffering patient, the British public feels.

WOMAN:

We just get don't get time to work overtime. The government are taking it all back in income tax.

WOMAN:

They promised that the family allowance would help working class people. But as fast as the family allowance went up so prices and taxation went up double.

WOMAN:

I can't manage on my husband's money; I have had to go out myself, you know, at night.

MAN:

How can you spread out costs when you've got SET to consider? It is very very difficult.

MAN:

SET is one of the biggest bugbears that one has to bear, I think.

MAN:

My pay over the last twelve years has doubled, but my standard of living has gone down by half.

WOMAN:

Oh - you take a pound note, it's gone; five pound, you take a five pound note and that's gone. It's terrible. Terrible.

MAN:

Bloody disgraceful.

WOMAN:

Terrible.

WOMAN:

Shocking.

WOMAN:

It is disgraceful. Everything has gone up: toothpaste, baby clothes, baby food - just everything you go for.

WOMAN:

We've got a good country to live in here haven't we ? If this government wasn't in. That's my idea of them.

IAIN MACLEOD:

Wilson says the Conservatives cannot do better. We couldn't do worse! Of course Wilson said that before and he was wrong before: In 1951 we promised to build three hundred thousand houses a year - an enormous increase on the Socialist performance. What did Mr Wilson say in his 1951 election address? "The Tory housing target is an electoral trick, a cruel deception on those who are waiting for a house. They know they cannot achieve it." But we did. We did. We made a pledge and we kept it. Wilson made a housing pledge; he broke it and there is the difference between us.
What is the situation now? The pound in October 1964 was worth twenty shillings. It was worth fifteen shillings eight pence in April of this year. Fifteen shillings seven pence today. And it would be worth ten shillings - a ten bob pound - if they won the election. We will halt that decline. How? We will have less government, fewer Ministers, fewer Ministries and cost reduction plans for every department. We shall abolish SET. We shall check state prices, control government spending, boost savings, and expand output. So we will stabilise prices and bring down taxes.

We will also reform and above all simplify taxation. All this can be done. After all we did it before. Look. Income tax - standard rate down by one shilling nine pence, up six pence. Purchase tax top rate one hundred percent when we came in down to twenty five percent and up again under the socialists to fifty five percent.

And what is the total result ? Look - look and remember. Under us tax rates dawn by two billion pounds. Under them tax rates up by three billion pounds. And what is our theme? In one word - choice. I believe in the people - not in Ministers: I believe in giving the people the freedom to spend more of their own money in their own way. I believe in the nation which earns and saves and owns and cares. I believe in choice resting in the family and with the individual and not in Whitehall: choose use on the eighteenth and you will have both freedom and choice.

Good night.
