21st April 1997

Synopsis
There is no speech in this broadcast. The soundtrack consists of 'Land of Hope and Glory'. This is played over images of the 1996 Conservative party conference. These images have been manipulated (by speeding-up, slowing-down and repeating sequences) to present the politicians and delegates extremely unflatteringly. Interspersed with the conference footage there are shots of people sleeping in hospital corridors, miserable looking old people in a nursing home, security camera footage of street-robbery, miserable children in school etc. There is a running commentary in the form of captions.
