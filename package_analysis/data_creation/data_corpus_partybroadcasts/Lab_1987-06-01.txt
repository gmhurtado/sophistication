1st June 1987

'THATCHER'S' VOICE:

No.

MAN'S VOICE:

No

MAN'S VOICE:

No

VOICE:

When it comes to education this is the government that like to say no.

'THATCHER'S' VOICE:

No you can't come in here you're not good enough. No you can't come to this school your parents can't afford it.

VOICE:

No we're not exaggerating. This is what Mrs Thatcher plans for your children's future: privileged schools, selective schools, education you have to pay for. But it doesn't come as a surprise because the Tories have been shutting doors on our children's future for eight years.

'THATCHER'S' VOICE:

No there are no nursery schools for you. No you two, it's not your turn for the book. No, no, no, class cancelled - there's no teacher for physics this term.

VOICE:

Teachers and parents know from bitter experience how little Mrs Thatcher cares about their children's education.

FEMALE PARENT:

parents' fund raising events are having to raise money for essentials quite often rather than the extras which is what it should be all about

VOICE:

The Tories are spending twenty percent less on children's books than when Mrs Thatcher came to power.

FEMALE TEACHER:

you've got people in mobile huts which are meant to be temporary but stay for a long time you've got classrooms with er bad decoration erm insufficient equipment

VOICE:

One in five schools is overcrowded, but then that's a problem that doesn't affect the Conservative education secretary and his colleagues - they send their children to private schools.

FEMALE TEACHER:

I think it's strange that he can see the benefit of small classes in the private sector and yet he isn't prepared to acknowledge that in the state sector

VOICE:

Our schools are short of one thousand physics teachers. Maths and other sciences also face crippling shortages.

MALE PARENT:

one of my children is being taught by a teacher who has no qualifications in the subject and my son is now coming up for examinations in one year's time and I am very concerned that he's not getting the standard of education which I really should expect for my child

VOICE:

And Mrs Thatcher's response to the crisis in the schools? Not a penny more for the books and equipment your children need. No, she says to parents - you'll have to pay.

FEMALE TEACHER/PARENT?:

no I don't think the government cares er at all about the comprehensive system in fact they'd like to destroy it erm because they don't believe in in free education for everybody even in equal education for everybody

VOICE:

Mrs Thatcher has no commitment to the future of ninety three percent of our children in state schools in Britain. Labour believes in them. We will open the door to a high quality education for all our children, whether their parents can afford to pay or not. We will provide nursery education for all our three and four year olds so that they get the best start in life. Labour will create real opportunity, providing the books, the equipment and the teachers that schools need. Labour will open the door to excellence. It will make classes smaller, boost English, maths and science teaching and introduce new educational grants to sixteen year olds. Neil Kinnock knows about state education. His wife is a teacher. His children go to state schools. Neil Kinnock and the Labour party want to make sure that being on the threshold of life means just that - not a dead end but a beginning.

KINNOCK SPEECH:

Today's Tories want to reintroduce the past, while we are determined to help people to equip themselves for the realities of the future. The basic choice in this election: past or future. That process of equipment will take time and it will take money and we'll do it because we know that costly though investment in education is, it is still cheaper - so much cheaper - than ignorance that's why [inaudible].
