8th October 1964

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

A welcome development in election politics has been the coffee meeting where people meet comfortably in each other's homes and talk about politics and meet their candidates. Now this evening we've got a version of that, but four of us are here in the 
Studio and then in a North London suburb Mrs. Murphy has gathered a group of her neighbours. Now when we establish contact with her we would like her and her neighbours to ask us questions to which we will do our best to give replies. Mrs. Murphy are you getting me clearly.

MRS. MURPHY:

Yes thank you Mr Callaghan.

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

Good. Well now would you like to fire some questions at us?

MRS. MURPHY:

Yes. First of all I'd like to talk about the rising cost of living. We're all very concerned about this and recently I read about the tea boys on building sites getting forty-two pounds a week. Don't you think this is a contributory factor?

GORDON WALKER:

Well I don't hold with that particular wage. I think it's an example of the way things have got out of proportion in this country to-day. But the question of the cost of living really raises much deeper issues than that. One of the first things we would have to do would be to make a real attack on monopolies, on price fixing. You know the present government allowed the Monopolies Commission almost to lose power. We will restore those powers. We will give it greater speed of action and we'll act upon its reports. Up to the present Government there are I think thirty reports which have not been acted on. Another thing we won't, we can't tolerate is the way some managements use wage increases for quite improper increases of price. Recently in the engineering industry there was an increase of five percent in wages - prices were put up five percent. But wages are only half the cost of production in that industry and would have justified therefore a much smaller price increase. That's one of the things we've got to stop.

QUESTION:

But how on earth can cost of living be stabilised for constant strikes and wage claims?

RAY GUNTER:

I don't know that there are constant strikes - let's get one fact clearly in our minds. That although there's a lot of press talk, there are less strikes in this country than in the majority of industrial countries. But the point to be remembered is this - that men are always blamed for strikes and you know any objective person looking into causes of strikes knows very well that half the strikes are caused by bad management. (Hear, hear) The channels of communication are bad inside industry. Now the Conservative Government you see has soured the whole thing. They have been unfair in this period of change. The great problems of redundancy are abroad because of changeover to automation and the rest of it. You remember the pay pause don't you in 1961? They cut right across the negotiating machinery, they placed a terrible burden on the nurses and the teachers, they acted unfairly. Now the British workman has not got low mentality. He understands the justice of a case. Put to him reasonably and on the understanding that justice will be done, he is prepared to share his responsibility and the Labour government when it is formed will do all within its power to really get a better attitude, well of confidence inside it.

QUESTION:

I wonder if I could possibly ask Mr Gunter a supplementary question here? Reading the newspapers this morning there was reported the fact that the Labour Party intended, if they were returned to power, to conduct urgent discussions with the Unions. Could you outline precisely what form these discussions would take?

RAY GUNTER:

Well one of the great problems this nation has to face of course is that we cannot spend more than we earn, that unless productivity rises by a sufficient amount then pay increases are a danger. What we want to do is to get the Unions with us, to sit down and think out how in equity the various and varied claims of different sections of the workers can be dealt with. And we shall do that in consultation with them and indeed I know that a large area of management of British industry would join with us in trying to find the answer to this most difficult problem.

QUESTION:

I know of a number of cases of old age pensioners who are very poor and yet are too proud to ask for National Assistance. What would the Labour Party do about this?

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

What we want to do is to establish a national minimum income. This will be a tremendous step forward in the whole of our social programme. Because for the first time we would try to fix levels below which no one living in this country should be allowed to fall. We would then like, having raised the pensioners incomes to that level so that they got them as of right and without recourse to the Assistance Board, we would then want to relate increases in pensions to increases in earnings so that as the average workers earnings went ahead so we could ensure that the pensioner didn't fall behind and create the conditions to which the questioner referred.

QUESTION:

What does Mr Callaghan think is the civil pension for an old age pension - the average pension.

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

Well it's much higher, it should be much higher than it is now and we shall certainly try to fix a level which will take pensioners off of National Assistance for all normal purposes. As to the future in the long run. If you ask me what the long run pension should be, well looking well ahead, I believe we ought to aim at pensions that are about half of average earnings, average earnings, I think this would be the sort of standard of life on which you could expect old people to live reasonably but that would have to be worked to by stages.

QUESTION:

Mr Callaghan I wonder if I could ask the panel a question on the subject of immigration. Now when the Immigration Act was introduced this was very firmly resisted by the opposite Party and I see no evidence to date of any intention on the part of the Labour Party to repeal this Act. Could you explain this?

GORDON WALKER:

There hasn't been any change of policy here. The Labour Party always believed and said that there must be controls over immigration. What we were arguing about in the House of Commons was the proper means of doing this. We didn't like the particular way the government suggested. The policy of the Labour Party is perfectly clear. We will keep on immigration controls, we hope by agreement with Commonwealth countries. We will give help from the central government to towns, areas where there is a concentration of immigrants. We believe that immigrants here, as the Prime Minister said, must be treated like everybody else but, of course, they must also live like the people they've come to settle amongst. We want them to get a good day's pay for a good day's work. We will also enact legislation to prevent incitement to racial hatred. We want to create the conditions under which good race relations, good harmonious race relations can steadily arise.

QUESTION:

I'd like to ask a question. One talks a lot and hears a lot of talk at election time on defence particularly. One of the things I've heard said quite a lot is that the Labour Party are going to leave the defence of Britain to the Americans. Is this true - what is going to happen if the Labour Party gets into power? What are you going to do about it?

DENIS HEALEY:

Well of course that story is complete nonsense. But no country in the world can stand alone in defence nowadays. Our security depends on our alliance and the Prime Minister has said this a great deal himself. Thanks to our alliance nuclear war has become very unlikely. If it did come we couldn't conceivably meet it alone. But it's vital to prevent every single country in the alliance having its own control over its own independent deterrent. That would mean Germany getting atomic weapons and a much greater risk of war than we have to-day. So we in the Labour Party think that our first priority in defence should be to equip our own troops properly where they are in fact fighting on the ground to-day - in Borneo, in the Middle East, all over the world. And we can't do that, we're not doing it at the moment because we're pouring hundreds upon hundreds of millions of pounds down the drain in a search for nuclear independence although in fact as you know, the latest thing is five hundred million pounds on building a Polaris programme entirely dependent on missiles from the United States.

QUESTION:

I'm very worried about the American bases in this country. Surely if America gets involved in a war, for example the Cuban crisis, we would also be involved and be a number one military target? What would the Labour Party do about this?

GORDON WALKER:

I'm perfectly certain there isn't going to be a nuclear war, but if there were, I'm afraid the whole world would be involved in it and it wouldn't matter where bases were. I think the essential thing is the first thing a Labour Government must do in the field of Foreign Policy, is to go to the United States and negotiate with them a transformation, a re-organisation of NATO so that we and the other European allies can share, participate with the United States in the control of nuclear strategy and policy for the alliance as a whole.

QUESTION:

I would like to ask Mr Callaghan of leasehold houses, and to get the ownership of the land.

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

Ray, you deal with this.

RAY GUNTER:

Well, of course, our proposals have been made very clear about the leasehold reform and we have said to the country that those leaseholders who are owner-occupiers and have had a lease that is over twenty one years in duration, we shall give them the chance to buy it at proper and decent rates. We shall ask them to pay, of course, the proper value of it. And that is that and that is how the leaseholder will be defended in the future.

QUESTION:

On the larger issue of housing anyway. This is a rich borough and yet I know that there are thousands of dilapidated houses, crowded with people. Just how quickly can the Labour Party get its programme for building these four hundred thousand houses a year into operation?

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

I think this is the whole case for economic planning. It's absolutely vital that we should have proper planning in this field of housing as elsewhere. Systems of industrialised building which have been in existence on the Continent for many years and are only just now coming into force in this country will help us to speed up new house building. We shall encourage local authorities by means of lower interest rates to go ahead and build as well as encouraging the house owners themselves, the new house owners, by lower interest rates and I think as important as anything, we shall deal with this land racket business. It really is intolerable the way the government has gone on year after year saying there's no solution and pouring scorn on the rest of us when we try to find one. We believe our Land Commission is the best solution that yet's been devised and I believe a combination of all these ways would enable us to get rid of what is a very considerable social scourge.

QUESTION:

If the Labour Party get in, how soon can they make all the changes regarding housing and land?

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

We'll make a start straight away. Leasehold reform that Mr Gunter spoke of, that can be introduced into the first session. But generally speaking, this has got to be a long term plan and I am not pretending, none of us has, that we're going to perform all these reforms within the space of twelve months. After all there are thirteen years in which some of these reforms could have been put into force and they haven't been put into force. But we believe, and we really mean this, that the fresh energy and the new leadership and policies that are based on the interests of the people will enable us to make a fresh start at an early date towards making a Britain of which we can all be proud.

QUESTION:

I'd like to, if we've still got time, to ask a question about education. That's a thing that most housewives are very concerned about. In State schools the classes are particularly large, much larger, unfortunately, than in private schools - forty and fifty in a class, I mean thirty is a small class. The only way to get over this obviously is to get more teachers. How are the Labour Party going to set about getting more teachers into the profession to reduce the size of classes?

DENIS HEALEY:

First of all I think we must encourage a lot more married women to go back to teaching when their children have grown up. But of course the real key is the wages of ordinary teachers. This must be improved. It means a new review of the wage structure in the teaching profession and of course it means building better schools than the schools the government is so ashamed of at the present time, it's actually suppressed its own report about the condition of them.

JAMES CALLAGHAN:

There's a representative group of questions from representative voters. They're not all members of the Labour Party, I just don't know how many of them are or how many of them are not - we've never met any of them, nor did we know the form that these questions were going to take. But we hope they've been as interesting to you as they were relevant to those who put them and to those of us who were trying to answer them. Good night.
