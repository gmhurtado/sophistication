23rd May 1983

ACTRESS IMPERSONATING THATCHER:

Great international companies are demonstrating their faith in Britain's future by choosing this country, under a Conservative government, as the location for major expansion. This is the way to get thousands of extra jobs for Britain.

JOHN SMITH:

Every hour since the Tories came to power yet another firm has bitten the dust. That's right, every time Big Ben has gone bong one more firm has gone bust. That's a hundred and sixty-four firms a week, eight and a half thousand firms a year, thirty four thousand firms gone in the four years since Britain decided it would be better off with the Conservatives. And the worst thing is, the shut-downs are speeding up. Of those thirty-four thousand closures, twelve thousand were in 1982. Multiply that by five more years of Tory mismanagement and another sixty thousand firms will have disappeared, and God knows how many millions more jobs, how many millions more onto the breadline, how many millions more children without a future.
It's the biggest industrial collapse in sixty years. No other developed European nation has suffered so badly. And if the Tories hadn't had twenty billion pounds worth of oil wealth to bail them out, things would've been even worse. Just look what's happened since 1979. Industrial output down by a fifth, car output down by a quarter, textiles output down by a third, steel output down by a half. In fact in 1982 for the first time ever Britain imported more industrial goods than it exported. But the Tories claim that it's only inefficient, uncompetitive firms that are going under. They'll tell you that Britain can't compete till its lazy, overpaid workers become more productive.

MALE VOICE:

So, how productive have the Tories made the British worker? Even with three and a half million unemployed and the threat of more output per worker has risen only five per cent in the last four years. But in the previous four years output per worker rose fourteen per cent, because Labour and the unions worked together. So much for the Tory claim to be making Britain more efficient. But why have they failed to do so? Quite simply they've refused to invest Britain's vital savings and oil riches where they're most desperately needed: in Britain. Instead they've invested in the dole queue, spending seventeen thousand million pounds, yes seventeen thousand million pounds, on maintaining the worst level of unemployment since the 1930s. Since 1979 Tory investment abroad has been bleeding Britain to death. Total investment abroad has been a monstrous thirty-five thousand million pounds, and while the Tories have helped Britain's competitors grow stronger investment in Britain's industry is down by a third. By starving Britain of money the Tories are literally demolishing British industry brick by brick. Look what happens when they say no to new factories: brickworks go bust, and glassworks, timber mills, electrical suppliers, plumbing suppliers. Their workers lose jobs so they can't buy clothes, the clothing shops go bust and their workers, and clothing factories go bust and their workers.

JOHN SMITH:

There's only one way to stop this Tory demolition job. It's by voting Labour on June 9th. Labour rebuilt war-damaged Britain after 1945 and Tory-damaged Britain after 1973. The moment you bring Labour back we'll start an emergency programme of investment in Britain's investment starved industry, transport, housing, new technology. Here's just one example of how it works. Invest money in sorely needed new homes and brickworks earn money. And all the other construction industries, they all need to take on new workers. The workers stop getting dole money and start buying clothes for their children again. Clothing shops order more from the clothing factories. The clothing factories order more from the textile industry, and all along the line more workers come off the dole and start buying things again. And that's just one example of how by investing in Britain, Labour can get Britain working again. But the Tories will tell you this is all pie in the sky. They'll tell you no - Britain can't afford the billions of pounds it will cost. Under the Tories that's absolutely true.

MALE VOICE:

When the Tories say we can't afford it, what do they mean? Do they mean we haven't the resources to do it? Of course we have. There are three million and more of them standing in the dole queue. If they were back at work, they could increase total output by about thirty thousand million pounds a year. And with that amount we could treble the education budget, or we could increase the house-building programme more than ten-fold. Or we could nearly double investment in private industry. Or perhaps they mean we can't finance it. Why not borrow then? Because, as we're told so often, we mustn't spend more than we earn. But every house-owning family in the country borrowed to but its house. Every expanding firm borrows to finance its growth. And since 1979 we have lent our foreign competitors thirty-five thousand million pounds. If it's all right for them to borrow our money, why can't we borrow our own and invest it here in Britain?

JOHN SMITH:

For the past four years the Tories have been demolishing Britain's industry. Demolishing Britain's jobs. Demolishing the lives of British people everywhere. Now on June 9th they want you to vote for five more years of the same bitter medicine. Are you really going to vote your firm out of business? Are you going to vote yourself out of a job? Are you going to vote for retirement at sixteen? Or are you going to think positive, act positive, and vote 'yes' for Labour?

YOUNG MAN:

I think this government, I think it's just destroying everything it's de- destroying employment as much as anything else and not putting anything in its place.

OTHER MAN:

Mrs Thatcher has an economic answer but it's it's an economic answer that does a few people a lot of good but not the majority as a whole.

OTHER MAN:

I mean if North Sea's here oil is here it really ought to be good for the British people and not others.

OTHER MAN:

I believe and I'm going to vote Labour cos I believe the Labour party will increase expenditure and that will find its way through and that will therefore benefit industry.

ANOTHER MAN:

Well I think that er the er oil probably could've been er much better spent than it has been, er it should certainly should have been used as an investment into business and er er far more so than it has been.

ANOTHER MAN:

I believe that the only chance for the future of the British people, and particularly the eleven million poor and the unemployed and everyone else is that er, we have to have a socialist government

JOHN SMITH:

Think positive, act positive, vote Labour.
