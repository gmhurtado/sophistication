24th March 1992 ('Jennifer's Ear')

A film (there is no dialogue - on the soundtrack we hear B.B. King singing 'Someone Really Loves You (Guess Who)')

Two little girls are both diagnosed on the same day with a condition called 'glue ear'. After being informed that there's a long waiting list for treatment on the NHS, one mother pays to go private and her child is soon well. But Jennifer's mother can't afford this, so we watch as the little girl continues to suffer and becomes withdrawn and aggressive at school. Finally, we see her sitting crying alone in a toilet.

NEIL KINNOCK:

I want every child in Britain to have the best. But thirteen years of the Conservatives have left us with a divided Britain, a two-tier Britain where opportunity and care increasingly depend on what you can afford to pay. If the Conservatives win they'll continue to privatise the National Health Service and make it more like the American system I don't want that and I know that you don't want it either. What we do want is a high quality National Health Service free at time of need, not one that's weakened by underfunding and opt-outs. The Labour government will modernise the National Health Service and we'll start immediately with an investment programme that means an extra billion pounds. It's part of building a Britain that works for all our children. On April the ninth the choice is between recession and recovery, between privatisation and modernisation. It's a choice between fear and hope. It's time for a change. It's time for Labour.
