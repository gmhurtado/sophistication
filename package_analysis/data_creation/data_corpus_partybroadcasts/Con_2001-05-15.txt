Synopsis

The broadcast is silent apart from a menacing soundtrack. The captions are accompanied by two sequences. The first shows three 'criminals' arriving in prison and being processed through the system - they are photographed, fingerprinted, and just when we might expect them to be locked in a cell, they are let out the front door. Once outside we see them indulging in criminal activity - attacking an old lady, burglary and drug dealing. The second sequence accompanies the captions dealing with petrol prices. We see a woman with two children walking down the street, looking longingly at a car with two children's seats in the back; an old lady sitting in her front room while her car sits unused in the front drive; a man in an isolated country cottage looks out the window at his car, grimaces, and then opens his fridge, which sadly contains only two tomatoes. Finally, we see a man in a wheelchair looking out the window at his vehicle.

CAPTIONS

Labour have let out 35,000 convicted criminals early under their Special Early Release Scheme.

That's 1,500 convicted robbers.

3,000 convicted burglars and nearly 5,000 convicted drug dealers and drug traffickers.

All let out before they've served even half of their sentences.

And what have they been doing, when they should have been serving time?

More thefts and robberies.

More burglaries.

More drug offences ...

.... and two rapes.

NOT ALL PARTIES ARE THE SAME

Conservatives will be tough on crime.

We will abolish Labour's Special Early Release Scheme.

***

British petrol is already the most expensive in Europe.

To pay for Labour's spending plans, they'll tax us more.

Petrol tax is Labour's favourite stealth tax.

A rise in tax could increase petrol to £1.30 a litre,

that's £6.00 a gallon, under Labour.

NOT ALL PARTIES ARE THE SAME

Conservatives will tax you less.

We will cut fuel tax by 6p a litre, that's 27p a gallon.

Vote for common sense.

Vote Conservative.
