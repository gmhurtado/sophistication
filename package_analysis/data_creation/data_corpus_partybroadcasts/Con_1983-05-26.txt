26th May 1983

VOICE OVER:

On Thursday June the ninth, if you had to vote with your savings, your wages, your house, your children's future, how would you vote? Each of the parties have set out in their manifestos what they will do if you elect them. One party for instance will withdraw us from the common market, it will disarm Britain unilaterally, scrapping our nuclear weapons, it will raise government spending massively and extend public ownership with state controls on private firms. This sounds like the Labour manifesto, oh it does point for point, but the text here is from the Communist manifesto. Never before have the two manifestos been so close, because Labour's answers to the policies that failed last time is to make them even more extreme this time.

ANONYMOUS MAN [Outdoors]

So let's compare how the lives of everyone would be affected under the Labour manifesto and the Conservative manifesto, starting with the issue that is the biggest single concern today: unemployment.

VOICE:

The Labour manifesto says spending money creates jobs, so they too plan to increase spending massively.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Well you don't need a crystal ball to see the effects of that, just a good memory.

VOICE:

Labour doubled its spending last time with this result - runaway inflation. And the result on unemployment? Unemployment still doubled despite all the money spent. The fact is every Labour government in history has increased unemployment.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

The real answer is to put a brake on government spending, not to increase it.

VOICE:

By doing exactly this the Conservatives have brought inflation down to four percent, the lowest figure for fifteen years. Lower costs mean industry can now begin to compete again.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Turning the tide against inflation has given us real hope of turning the tide against unemployment.

VOICE OVER:

The next issue that faces us is state control.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Labour want to control your life - the very opposite of what the Conservatives want.

VOICE:

Why should the state choose your children's school? It's for you to choose, so the Conservatives have given you legal rights to do so. Why should the state own your home? If you're going to be allowed to live in it shouldn't you be allowed to buy it? So the Conservatives have given all council tenants the right to buy. What about trade union reform? The Conservatives believe you should be free to decide whether you want to belong to a trade union or not. There should be a secret ballot to choose union leaders and for members to be consulted before any strike is called.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Most union members want these reforms, but not the union leaders and naturally enough not the Labour manifesto.

VOICE OVER:

Labour are also against the common market.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Labour claim to be in favour of reducing unemployment but they also want to take us out of the common market.

VOICE:

Two and a half million jobs put at risk because the left don't want us to be part of Europe. How is Britain to be defended? Since 1940 the Soviet empire has expanded , invading country after country too weak to resist her. The Labour manifesto would gamble with Britain's defences by removing the nuclear deterrent that has kept the peace in Europe for almost forty years.

MICHAEL HESELTINE TALKING HEAD:

You could understand why the Communist manifesto wants to give Russia an easy ride, but why do Labour want to? No Labour government has taken a risk on Soviet intentions. Clement Atlee didn't. Harold Wilson didn't. Jim Callaghan didn't. But Michael Foot wants to. Never before have the alternatives been so stark. The other parties' manifestos are full of gloom and doom - naturally enough, how else will they persuade you to vote for them if what we are doing is succeeding? And however much they would like to protest, the truth is that here at home confidence is brushing aside pessimism, and abroad for the first time in years Britain is regarded as a country with a great future as well as a great past. On June the ninth let's not throw away all that's been accomplished in the last four years.

VOICE OVER:

Britain's on the right track, don't turn back
