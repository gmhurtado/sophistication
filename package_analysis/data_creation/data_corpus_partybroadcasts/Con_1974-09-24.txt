24th September 1974

JOHN MOORE (on telephone):

Hello, John Moore here.

TOM KING:

This is Tom King. Down in the south west we have already seen all too clearly one aspect of the present crisis, and this has been the appalling increase in rates. People have been faced with ever-rising prices in the shops, substantial increases in so many bills, and then suddenly on top of it all the savage increase in rates.

SARAH HOGG:

Sarah Hogg here.

MARCUS FOX:

Marcus Fox. Er, this is an industrial area in the north. We have known hard times in the past when jobs were impossible to find and today there is unease and a fear that it could happen again, a feeling that things are not right and yet what can be done. Is it so inevitable, and are we so helpless to prevent it.

JOHN MOORE:

John Moore here.

ERIC COCHRANE:

Eric Cochrane in the north west. People here are very worried about unemployment, which is going up steadily. Everywhere I go people ask "Look, we've heard a lot about crises in the past from politicians. Is this crisis really different from previous ones?"

JOHN MOORE:

People in this country are more worried than at any time since the war. Britain faces an economic crisis, and they're waiting to see what, if anything, can be done about it. During the election campaign, we shall be listening to the things that are on your mind as you make up your mind on how you'll vote in the most important general election in our lifetime. All over the country Conservative candidates will be going round, talking to people in their constituencies and they'll be keeping in touch with us here.

SARAH HOGG:

In turn. we shall be keeping in touch with Conservative shadow ministers and putting your questions to them. What would a new Conservative government do to put Britain back on course in this crisis? But perhaps we should really begin by asking is there a crisis, and how bad is it? What are the facts?

GEOFFREY JOHNSON-SMITH:

Let's look at the facts. And the fact is that Britain is in the red. This year alone we're having to borrow four thousand million pounds to pay for the things we buy. Now that's two hundred pounds for every family in this country - three times what it was a year ago. Now it would be one thing if being in debt solved all our other problems. But it doesn't. Take inflation. Last year it was going up at the rate of nine percent. Today it's doubled. Eighteen percent. Although, um, yesterday Mr Healey seemed to make it come out at only eight point four percent, and so the Conservative and Liberal manifestos were telling lies. I can only imagine he hadn't read this: "Inflation afflicts all the countries of the world. From Japan to France, from the United States to Britain, prices are rising at between fifteen and twenty five percent a year". And that comes from the Labour party manifesto.

So even Labour agree that inflation is a world wide problem these days. Well then, is it so bad if we're all in the same boat? The trouble is, it's not the same boat. Because this time last year Britain was sixth in the inflation league table. Today we've dropped to tenth. There's only Italy between us and the second division. Now if you think er inflation is an abstract sort of word, let's look at prices. The same story: up and up. The Labour government has made efforts, but they've only made things worse. And it's not just the price of things in the high street. It's all the other bills that keep landing on the mat. Any one of them is up by between fifteen and thirty percent. And then there are the rates. This year they've risen by up to fifty pence in the pound, and they won't stop there. But perhaps it's worth putting up with all that because at least we've all got a job, and that's something to be grateful for. But have we all got a job? Today, six hundred and forty seven thousand of us haven't. And you can see the trend. Before long it could be off the chart.

And that's just where it will go if wages go on rising. In the last year we've given ourselves. at least some of us have, an increase in our wage packet of twenty percent. And what have we done to earn it? How much more have we produced? Ten percent, fifteen percent? Nothing - absolutely nothing. We're paying ourselves what we haven't earned. That's what this crisis is about, and that's a fact.

JOHN MOORE (?):

Those are the facts. Are we in a vicious circle that can't be broken? Or could the new Conservative government get us out of it, and how? Earlier today Sarah Hogg talked to EDWARD HEATH.

SARAH HOGG:

Mr Heath, when we talked about this crisis last week you said something that intrigued me. You said no government could save this country unless the country wanted to save itself.

EDWARD HEATH:

Yes.

SARAH HOGG:

Well how can we save ourselves?

EDWARD HEATH:

By uniting on the things we have in common. Why should we British always emphasise our differences? We ought to concentrate on the things which unite us, not on those things which divide us.

SARAH HOGG:

But even if we can agree on what's gone wrong, can we agree about how to put it right?

EDWARD HEATH:

Yes, I believe that there's a great area with things which we hold in common er which would enable us to overcome this crisis.

SARAH HOGG:

What are these things we have in common?

EDWARD HEATH:

Well, first of all let us agree that if we're going to be able to pay for what we buy from overseas our industry has got to be able to produce the goods. Then let us put fresh heart into industry, let us banish the threat of nationalisation which hangs over so much of it and the threat of state interference and control from departments in Whitehall and from civil servants.

SARAH HOGG:

Er it's easier to discourage industry though than to encourage it. Just how would you put heart back into industry?

EDWARD HEATH:

Well, the one of the main problems which industry is finding at the moment is that it just hasn't got the cash to enable it to carry on its daily activities, yet alone to invest. Er, the government in fact has been taking so much cash in the form of taxation. We've simply got to put this right. And on the shop floor men now and women are in fear of losing their jobs. They see unemployment mounting and we've got to be able to show them that if they are producing more, if industry has got the means to carry on its activities, why then this is in the national interest and their jobs will become more secure.

SARAH HOGG:

But they will only become secure if we can have industrial peace. How can you guarantee that?

EDWARD HEATH:

No man, no government can guarantee industrial peace, but I do believe that there is when there is a proper realisation of this crisis by all those who are working in industry, management and men, then surely they will have new approach to industrial relations and realise there's really no place in this country at the moment for the waste of production which ensues every time we have a strike er or a stand off of some kind or other.

SARAH HOGG:

But how can you convince them of this, how can you convince them that your government will be a truly national government?

EDWARD HEATH:

Because we in the Conservative party are putting forward policies which we believe the great majority of people in this country can accept, and which they will recognise are in the national interest. That is why I am asking for a Conservative government to be returned with a majority, and when we have our majority then I will consult with the other party leaders in parliament, all of them, and with those outside of parliament so that we can get the widest possible measure of agreement on the er action necessary to overcome this crisis.

SARAH HOGG:

But what could this national government do that an ordinary one party Tory or Labour government couldn't?

EDWARD HEATH:

I believe it can produce policies which will have the support of the great majority of the people of this country and it'll be because that is evident within parliament that we shall get the response of a united country to the action which we take. I'm absolutely certain that that is the only way we can overcome a crisis of the scale, magnitude and kind which is facing us at the moment.

SARAH HOGG:

Mr Heath, thank you.
