5th June 1987

VOICE:

In the 1930s most of the western world began to disarm believing this was the way to peace. In 1939 Europe learned the bitter lesson of what happens when only one side disarms. In the 1940s the Soviets began to expand, swallowing countries that were too small, too isolated to protect themselves. But take a look where they stopped - at the NATO borders. The world has remained a deeply dangerous place, yet while wars have raged outside, inside western Europe we've enjoyed forty two years of peace for one reason and one reason alone - in NATO we have the unity, the strength and the determination to defend ourselves. Even though the Soviet Union has the most powerful army in the world they won't dare to threaten us as long as we possess an effective nuclear deterrent. But look what happens when we relax even slightly. Between 1972 and 1979 we in the West did not introduce a single new intermediate missile into Europe. The Russians however deployed four hundred SS20 missiles each with three warheads targeted at us. In the early 1980s we had no option but to counter-act this threat . We installed cruise missiles. Did this decision jeopardise peace? Not at all, it brought the Russians back to the negotiating table. The Russians are talking to us today no thanks to CND, no thanks to Labour and the Alliance who voted against cruise, but because of this government's determination to defend our country.

TORY MINISTER:

Everything we do in defence is designed to keep the peace and make war less likely. We do want to reduce nuclear weapons but we will only do so if we are sure that the Russians reduce theirs. That is our approach. Mr Kinnock's approach is quite different.

VOICE:

If Mr Kinnock were to be elected to power in just seven days from now he would order our Polaris submarines to stop their patrols and return to be scrapped. He would cancel Trident, he would throw out the American nuclear bases and remove all our Cruise missiles. Mr Kinnock would do all this without requiring the Russians to surrender a single nuclear weapon of theirs. No wonder Denis Healey said the Russians are praying for a Labour victory.

TORY MINISTER:

If Labour took power we would be completely exposed to nuclear blackmail, not just by Russia but by any other country large or small who might soon have their own nuclear bomb. How would we reply to threats like that?

VOICE:

According to Mr Kinnock we would use the resources you've got to make any occupation untenable, so this is his policy - let them occupy first then fight afterwards, just like in Afghanistan where people are being killed every day under the Russian occupation. Despite the lesson of 1939, despite what has happened since, Labour wants to abandon the defence strategy that has kept us safe for over forty years. Luckily they are not the government of this country, because against armed might like this they will effectively leave us defenceless.

TORY MINISTER:

You don't prevent wars when just one side gives away its weapons. You do prevent wars by being strong enough to bring the other side to the negotiating table. This is what we have achieved . Working with our allies we are now in sight of what will be an historic achievement - the first ever reduction in nuclear arms. We are negotiating this reduction from strength, but Mr Kinnock would have nothing to negotiate with so he could achieve nothing but endanger everything. On June the eleventh I urge you to vote for a Britain kept safe and strong by the Conservatives.
