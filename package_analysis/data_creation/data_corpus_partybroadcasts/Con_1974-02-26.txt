26th February 1974

VOICE OVER:

June the eighteenth, 1970. A new tenant takes over an old address, and makes a pledge.

EDWARD HEATH:

This government will be at the service of all the people - the whole nation. Our purpose is not to divide, but to unite and where there are differences, to bring reconciliation. To create one nation.

VOICE OVER:

In February 1974 he finds himself fighting that same battle with more than just a political outcome at stake.

HEATH:

Our message to the militants is clear. We've had enough of you. We're going to get on with the job. It's time to take a firm line, because only by being firm can we hope to be fair.

VOICE OVER:

You don't get to be Prime Minister without being a fighter and in getting to Downing Street Ted HEATH took on a battle they said couldn't be won - and won it. And he would need every bit of grit and determination to tackle a world more torn with conflicts than at any time since the war - conflicts that could only be resolved by meeting and talking.

VOICE OVER:

But in today's world talk takes travel. No Prime Minister has travelled further to put the British point of view, or put it to better effect. Before long foreign observers would note with relief that Britain was out in the world again.
It was late - but not too late. And it would pay dividends.

But the outside world is only one of a modern Prime Minister's concerns. There are all those thousands of miles to be covered up and down the country - more talking, more listening. All the time keeping a finger on the pulse because how can you govern a country unless you know that country? Ted HEATH knows his country and he's come to know it the way he knows best - the hard way. And that way you learn more about what's going on in people's minds and hearts, than anybody stuck behind a desk in Whitehall.

VOICE OVER:

This is a man who got where he is by knowing what's going on. At press conferences seasoned journalists agree they'd never come across anyone with such a complete grasp of the whole range of government. HEATH is a practical man. He likes to see things run efficiently. To do that you need a strong team around you. He has that team. Their combined experience and different talents makes the HEATH government one with real depth. They've not been afraid to tackle some of the more deep-seated problems that have beset us for years. HEATH himself is proud of the fact that we have tried to do things other governments have only talked about doing. Ireland was one of them. "It haunts us every day," said HEATH. "It requires patience, imagination, and indeed humility to solve." But after hundreds of years of bloodshed a real solution seemed in sight. Deep-seated problems don't go away overnight. For more than half a century unions have struck attitudes with employers, employers with unions. The HEATH Government actually did something: they started a dialogue that offered a real chance of partnership. A real solution to strife. We no longer live in ordinary times. It takes an extraordinary man to be Prime Minister. But this is an extraordinary man. A private man; a solitary man. These are some of the words that have been used to describe him. Perhaps single-minded sums it up. For this is a man with one concern: what happens to this country. "If I have one ambition," he said, "it is to move this country on." This is a man the world respects. A man who has done so much and yet a man who has so much left to do. One remark sums up how many people feel. On a walkabout during the election campaign a reporter heard a woman in the crowd say: "I don't know much about politics but I'll tell you one thing - we've only got one man who can do the jobs and that's Ted HEATH."

EDWARD HEATH:

Remember what this election is about. We are fighting inflation. If we don't go on fighting it it will cripple us all - not only for now but for a generation to come, maybe more. So it's your children you're voting for, too. The government has a policy to beat inflation. It's not easy but it's fair and it's fair for everyone. And it's working. If you vote for a Conservative government it will go on working. But you must decide. The alternative is to encourage a powerful minority - any powerful minority - to believe they can bend the rules of the game when it suits them, and make no mistake - if you vote any other way that is the risk you'll run. You may think you're voting for other things, with the beat of intentions but you could end up with more than you bargained for. It's a short cut to chaos. But you must decide. What you must not do is turn away. There's no excuse for saying after the event "Don't blame me, I didn't do anything." When you vote ask yourself this question: will you be voting for something or against everything else? Are you giving your vote or giving it away? The line of least resistance can lead to the most dangerous destinations. It's no good saying we'll stand firm next time. This is next time. It's time to be for something.

These last three and a half years we've tried to be for something, for quite a lot of things. We haven't done enough yet, we know that. We've made our mistakes. But we have worked, and cared, and done things that other governments have just talked about doing and I'm proud of that. We've made this country something to be reckoned with once more. And I am proud of that. We've begun to create a partnership for progress between management and the unions and we've come a lot further, a lot faster than many people believed possible. And I'm proud of that. And we've begun to strike a better balance in our society so that the people who can't stand up for themselves are still given their fair share, without having to beg for it. And I'm particularly proud of that. We've tried to be strong - not just for the sake of being strong but because only the strong can protect the weak. You've got to be strong to be moderate. It's weakness that leads to extremism. You must have strength to influence events. If a government has no power to do what has to be done at home it has no voice in the world outside either. I'm sure sometimes you feel that world outside takes up too much of our time. Perhaps it seems we're so busy with that we can't possibly know or care what's happening in your street, to your life. Well if you think that, ask one of the eight million pensioners, because they know we've done something to make their lives better. And ask the three million of the lower paid whether they haven't had a better deal these last three and a half years. And ask one of the two million families living in a home made easier by a rent rebate.

In fact, ask any one of those millions of people who have no strong trade unions to argue their case. They haven't needed one because this government has had the strength to look after their interests. We are their trade union. People tell me I'm stubborn. Well, is it stubborn to fight and fight hard to stop the country you love from tearing itself apart? And is it stubborn to see that everyone in that country should have the choice and the chance to take his life and make of it what he can? And is it stubborn to want to see this country take back the place that history means us to have? If it is - then, yes, I most certainly am stubborn. But surely stubborn means not giving-up when the going gets rough. And isn't stubborn another way of saying determined? We've had to be determined these last few years for no government in recent times has been more tested by events and each one has been dealt with firmly and decisively. We shan't get on by giving up. We can't go on saying to the rest of the world - go away, come back later, we're not ready for you. That's being afraid of our future. We have never been afraid of the unknown. Dangers have never deterred us. Whatever the future holds we must seize it, we must shape it. If there is fire we shall face it and come through it stronger, wiser and more at one with each other. We've never failed to yet. I love this country. I'll do all that I can for this country. And isn't that what you want to do, too? We've started a job together. With your will we shall go on and finish the job.

VOICE:

Ask yourself this about the party you're thinking of voting for. Is it strong? Is it united? Could it do the job? Does it have the leaders? Would the world respect it? Vote Conservative - it must be the right thing to do.
