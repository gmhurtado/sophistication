3rd June 1983

ANONYMOUS MAN [Outdoors]

Today we'd like to talk to you about one thing and one thing only: unemployment. Which party is most likely to create new jobs? Labour promised to bring unemployment down to one million, but if they have a magic formula for creating jobs why didn't they use it during their last period of government?

VOICE:

What they did try was a massive increase in government spending: they doubled it.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

But did all the money Labour spent help unemployment? No. The record shows that unemployment still doubled.

VOICE:

You'd think that Michael Foot would have learnt the lesson.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

But no. Labour's answer to unemployment is still a massive increase in government spending . But why should that work any better this time?

VOICE:

The fact is that every single Labour government in history has increased unemployment.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

If Mr Foot were to be elected the odds are that he would create more unemployment than any other Labour Prime Minister before him. Here's why.

VOICE:

He would cut our defences at the cost of over four hundred thousand jobs in our defence forces and industries, and he would take us out of the common market in spite of the two and a half million jobs that depend upon our trade with Europe - two and a half million jobs put at risk just to please Labour's left wingers. Delightful, isn't it? Labour's massive spending ideas lead only to more taxes which you have to pay; more borrowing which you have to pay back; and inflation which means you have to pay more for everything. But if Labour's plan won't work what's the solution?

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Four years ago the Conservatives set about rebuilding the prosperity of Britain. The going has not been easy because the problems facing Britain were so huge.

VOICE:

The most urgent problem was inflation, because as Jim Callaghan himself had said inflation is the mother and father of unemployment.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

With high inflation our prices were roaring ahead of our rivals, so we were losing orders, we were losing customers and we were losing jobs.

VOICE:

Inflation is down to four percent, the lowest in fifteen years and lower than most of our competitors.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

So we are winning back orders, we are winning back customers, and beginning to win back jobs.

VOICE:

The second big problem was strikes. Do you remember when the world used to joke about our strikes? We had strike after strike, and even strikes about strikes and sadly the only new jobs that our winter of discontent created was for our competitors. Strikes cost Britain jobs.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

That too has changed. British industry is now losing less output due to strikes than for thirty years.

VOICE:

The third problem was training.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

We simply were not giving enough of our young people the skills they needed for work: new jobs need new skills.

VOICE:

This is the vicious circle that has stopped our youngsters from getting new jobs. No experience no job, and no job no experience - but now this is the break in the circle. From September for every new school-leaver who fails to get a job the new youth training scheme will guarantee a year's training and work experience. So let's sum up. Because we're getting inflation under control, unemployment is now rising slower here than in Canada, Holland or West Germany. Lower inflation keeps costs down and that has enabled our industries to become more competitive. Because we're becoming more competitive so exports have risen to record levels. As business recovers so the number of small businesses is growing by hundreds every month. And as the recovery continues so existing jobs are being secured and new jobs are being created.

NORMAN TEBBIT:

If you look back you'll see it wasn't only the world recession that lost jobs in Britain. Labour's rising prices and the constant strikes by militants had driven away customers and jobs. Now we're on top of inflation, productivity is up and strikes are down. We're winning back customers and that means jobs. This government is fighting hard to defeat unemployment.

VOICE:

On June the ninth for the sake of all the unemployed people in this country vote Conservative. Britain's on the right track , don't turn back.
