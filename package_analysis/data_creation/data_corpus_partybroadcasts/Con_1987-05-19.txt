19th May 1987

VOICE:

Man is born free. That is his natural state, his God-given right. Nowhere is this tradition more deeply held than in Britain. Oft in our long history we have stood alone facing the mightiest armies of the world to defend our freedom, sometimes at tremendous sacrifice, never doubting that this price is worth paying. Freedom has been both our strength and our battle-cry. If we have a fault it arises out of our respect for freedom. In war we rally and win. In peace we are less vigilant. Our famous tolerance has allowed imported ideologies like Marxism and its step-brother socialism to creep into our [inaudible]. These ideas are foreign to our [inaudible], for we are a proud nation of individuals. We flourish under freedom. In the winter of 78-79 - the infamous winter of discontent - socialism had left our dead unburied, our streets full of rotting rubbish, and our national pride only a distant memory. On May the third 1979 the British people turned their back on socialism and failure. We elected a new government and a new leader.

THATCHER:

Let me give you my vision: a man's right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the state as servant and not as master. These are the British inheritance. They are the essence of a free economy and on that freedom all our other freedoms depend.

VOICE:

The balance of power was returned from the state to the individual. Give the people back their economic freedom, allow the spirit of enterprise to rise again. In 1979 we in Britain were one of the most highly taxed nations in the industrialised world, and because of this one of the least productive. Step one was to return to each person the lion's share of his wages. The basic rate of income tax has been cut to its lowest level for fifty years.

ACTOR ONE:

I'm a worker. Because I kept more of what I earned it paid me to work harder.

ACTOR TWO:

I'm his employer, and because we worked harder the business did better.

ACTOR THREE:

I'm the tax man. Because his business did better he paid more tax so the government could spend more on hospitals and education and still cut taxes again.

ACTOR ONE:

And because I then kept more of what I earned I worked even harder.

ACTOR TWO:

And because we worked even harder the business did even better and we were able to employ more people and do even better still.

ACTOR THREE:

And because his business did even better still it paid even more tax so the government was able to cut taxes again.

VOICE:

It sounds a fine theory - lower rates of tax yet more government spending, and without the need for high borrowing and rampant inflation. Did it work ? Look at the facts. Fact one: since 1979 the Conservative government has cut the basic rate of income tax by just under one-fifth. Fact two: since 1979 take home pay for an average married worker has risen by just over one-fifth. Fact three: since 1979 the manufacturing productivity per worker has gone up by one-third. Fact four: since 1979 company productivity has risen by over a half. Fact five: since 1979 the government's spending on health, education, pensions, defence, everything has risen even after taking inflation into account by nineteen billion pounds.

NIGEL LAWSON:

This improvement in Britain's fortunes is no fluke, no happy accident. It is the result of deliberate Conservative policy. By giving people economic freedom we have given the country economic prosperity. Without the one you cannot have the other. The key is simply this: to give to the people what is rightly theirs.

VOICE:

The Conservative government has given the people back more than their taxes. The Conservatives have given the unions back to their members. Secret ballots and trade union reforms have introduced a breath of democracy into labour relations. Admittedly it was unpopular with certain union leaders but the members seemed to like it. Fact: strikes are now at their lowest levels for fifty years. The Conservatives have given council tenants the right to buy their own homes, admittedly this wasn't too popular with some left-wing councils but the tenants seemed to like it. Fact: over one million council homes have been sold to their tenants. The Conservatives are returning industry to the people. British Telecom, British Gas, Rolls Royce, British Airways - over one-third of all former state industries are now owned by the public. Admittedly some trade union leaders and Labour politicians don't like it but the public seem to. Fact: since 1979 over five and a half million more people have become share-holders in British industry. One and a half million British workers now own shares in the company they work for.

GEOFFREY HOWE:

All these measures are extremely unpopular with socialists because in allowing the individual more freedom the people have become stronger and a strong people has no desire for the shackles of socialism.

VOICE:

No wonder the number of individual paid up members of the Labour party has declined by half over the last eight years.

YOUNG:

This remarkable recovery of Britain has not been achieved without effort or sacrifice and in spite of the fact that this government has created more new jobs than the rest of the European community put together the level of unemployment is too high. Unemployment has been rising in Spain, in France, in Ireland, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Italy and yes Japan. Yet for the best part of the last twelve months it has been falling in Britain. The revival in our economy is creating more and more new jobs. The task is far from complete. The British people are taking up the challenge of enterprise and freedom with enthusiasm

VOICE:

Fact: self-employment has risen by three quarters of a million. Under Labour of course it fell. Fact: over five hundred more new businesses are being set up every week. Last year new company start-ups reached record levels.

YOUNG:

Today Britain is enjoying the kind of success that we used to associate with other countries, for we grew up believing that success belonged to Japan, to the United States, to France, to Germany, to almost anybody but ourselves.

VOICE:

Today France's unemployment is rising, ours is falling. Last year the United States became an international debtor, but Britain is now an international creditor. Even Japan is finding it harder and harder to increase its productivity, yet our productivity is rising faster. Germany has had one of the best growth rates in Europe, but ours is even better. Our overseas reputation has seldom been higher - it's great to be great again.
