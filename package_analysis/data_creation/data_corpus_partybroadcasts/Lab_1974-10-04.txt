4th October 1974

ROY JENKINS:

Too much talk at election time is about who will win. I want to talk about who will deserve to win. In my view it'll be the party which can show the best prospect of an advanced appearance which makes sense in our present economic difficulties. In a moment you will see Shirley Williams talking about prices, Tony Crossland on housing, and Barbara Castle on the Health Service. These are vital matters, but beyond them there is the fact that many women have a raw deal at work and often in the rest of their lives as well. We'll announce radical proposals for ending as much of this discrimination as it is possible to do by law. The equal pay act will be in full operation by the end of next year, but equal pay must be accompanied by equal opportunities, to be trained for worthwhile jobs and then to get them. And worthwhile jobs and equal pay are not enough if there persists alongside them the indignities of unequal treatment in getting a house or borrowing money or social security provisions. Our measures will end this. They will enable half our population to fulfil their potential to make a greater contribution and to live more worthwhile lives.

MARJORIE PROOPS (?):

Mrs Williams, I'd like to ask you the sort of questions housewives are asking, the sort of women who write and to me and say 'I'm a mere housewife.' They say, 'We're told the Labour government is getting inflation under control, but where's the evidence of that?'

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

Well I don't believe there are 'mere' housewives. I think that housewives and for that matter their husbands as well are quite intelligent enough to understand the ways in which we can deal with inflation and the things we can't do. Whenever said as a government we would cut prices at a stroke, we knew we couldn't do that. What we did say we would do would be to restrain the galloping rate of inflation and we have. We've started out by introducing food subsidies and by cutting the profits in the retail trade by ten percent.

MARJORIE PROOPS (?):

You spoke er a moment ago about subsidies, are they really the best way to protect the most vulnerable like the elderly and the poor?

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

The trouble with means tested benefits of the sort the Tories often say we should have used is that they don't reach people who are either too proud or in some cases too ill or too old to apply for them. We wanted to reach everybody. Now some people say 'oh well it's all indiscriminate the millionaire gets a subsidy as well as the pensioner'. So he does, but he pays a devil of a lot for it because taxes to the better off have gone up to pay for the subsidies. It is the less well off who are getting the full benefit, and it's quite a benefit, it's about sixty pence a week for the ordinary family - it will shortly go up to over seventy pence a week - and about thirty five pence a week for the pensioner couple. We think that's a relief worth having.

MARJORIE PROOPS (?):

What about the future? As one hard-pressed housewife said to me only yesterday 'where's it all going to end?'

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

It's not going to end immediately. We've made it quite clear as a party that we are going to go through and we are going through a difficult time as a country and so are almost all other countries in the western world. A lot depends on our own willingness as a country to act in a grown up manner, that's what we mean by the social contract. In my view it covers workers at home as well as workers in the factories and the offices.

WOMAN:

As with prices so with housing. Labour's plans embrace every family's housing needs.

ANTHONY CROSSLAND:

It was under a Labour government that the proportion of people owning their own house for the first time ever in British history rose above fifty percent, rose above half. It was the Tories who clobbered the owner-occupier, they let the price of houses double, they let the mortgage rate go up from eight and a half percent step by step to eleven percent. At the end they had created a total mortgage famine, and they let the whole programme of building houses for the home buyer erm go into a state of total ruin and collapse. The argument against the Thatcher plan is that it is not only grossly unfair within the group of people who have got a mortgage - within that group it helps the better off worse more than the worse off - but also it doesn't help the whole of the rest of the population who generally have lower incomes. I mean take the most extreme example, it does nothing to help the homeless, all the people who are on a council house waiting list, all the people - and there are millions - who are living now in substandard er conditions, it doesn't help those in the slightest degree, so the whole er the whole plan goes absolutely counter to the kind of compassionate and just philosophy we are trying to express through the social contract.

WOMAN:

The Conservatives showed little compassion for the lower paid, the teachers, the postmen, the nurses when they were in power.

BARBARA CASTLE:

When I took over I found a very very low state of morale. I don't know how many of you marched against me but I I I can under I understood why because during the past three and a half years average basic wage rates rose thirty eight percent faster than nurses' pay. The Labour government has injected nearly three hundred million pounds more money into the Health Service in the past few months to meet pay increases a-and to meet rises in costs but I think that is one of the priorities in in this country and I certainly wouldn't be prepared to sacrifice the National Health Service in order to try and solve the country's economic difficulties, I think that'll be a way to make them worse.

ROY JENKINS:

You have just seen some of the things which we've done in seven months. We're not making promises which we can't keep. People are rightly sceptical of extravagant offers, particularly at a time when everyone knows we're facing formidable tasks and menacing economic problems. The electorate values performance more that vote-catching. Sensible plans for ordered progress towards a fairer society are essential, but a prospectus for easy prosperity next year would earn cynicism and not respect. At the same time we must raise our eyes above the foothills of politics. This election is more than a struggle about statistics. I reject death-bed conversions to national unity which are just a device to keep a defeated Conservative party in power. And we must answer them with our own convincing plans for healing the wounds of the nation.

A separated and divided country, with everyone pursuing only their own individual interests, nursing their own grievances, certainly won't give us either a fairer or a stronger Britain. The most dangerous recipe for a mean, reactionary, inward-looking, petty minded society is to set one group's grievances against another - the old against the young, pensioners against the families, council house tenants against the owner-occupiers, workers against management, countryside against the cities, Britain against the world. If we look around us, in our everyday lives, I think we would most of us agree those who have the most satisfying lives are those who work for others as well as for themselves. The same is as true as a nation as of individuals.

This is the broad-based appeal to conscience and reform which brought me into the Labour party. It embraces I believe the best part of the old liberal tradition of tolerance and freedom. It is socialist because it puts the community first. It is national because it can secure a strong Britain which the alternative harsh materialism has dismally failed to do. It is internationalist, because it recognises that humanity does not stop at the shores of this island. It offers a way out of the blind-alley of gloom and despondency, division and frustration, into which we have been for too long led. It is a basis on which we can both win the election and serve the nation. It is a message of justice and of hope for the future.

WOMAN:

For a better deal for women, for families, for pensioners, vote Labour.
