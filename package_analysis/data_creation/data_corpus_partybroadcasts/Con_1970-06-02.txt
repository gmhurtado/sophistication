2nd June 1970

WOMAN:

I wouldn't vote for either party. I've got to the stage where I couldn't care less - like them.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

Good evening and welcome to the first edition of A Better Tomorrow. Tonight we are going to try and analyse just what this election is all about, just what is going through people's minds as they prepare to vote, and later you will be hearing from the leader of the Conservative Party - Edward Heath. But first Chris Chataway.

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

The record of this Labour government is already well documented. If you believe people should be taken at their word Mr Wilson and his colleagues have certainly given us plenty of words to take them at. Let's look at a few of them. From the last election year 1966 we were told: You know Labour government works. And we have Mr Callaghan saying : "I do not foresee the need for severe increases in taxation" even though they increased taxation by three thousand million a year. And then unemployment. This is what Mr Wilson said "We see no reason why unemployment should rise at all apart from seasonal increases."

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

It must be a bad season. My figures show there has never been so many unemployed for so long since the 1930s. In 1966 Mr Wilson again : "As to the idea of freezing of wage claims, salary claims, I think this would be monstrously unfair. I do not think you can ever legislate for wage increases and no party is setting out to do that."

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

Are you sure that was 1966? I thought I heard something similar from Mr Wilson only the other day.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH

Well - yes, he did; but don't forget, 1966 was election year too and election years do seem to bring out the familiar phrases. What about this bit about living standards from the 1966 Labour Party manifesto ? "For the next five years living standards for the individual and for the whole community will rise by twenty five percent."

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

And the actual figure was just over one percent a year but of course next time will be better as no doubt, it will be for housing.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

"We have embarked on a massive expansion of the housing programme" - Mr Wilson again - "reaching by 1970 no less than five hundred thousand new dwellings. This is not a lightly given promise, it is a pledge".

CHRISTOPHER CHATAWAY:

In the event, it was only three hundred and sixty seven thousand dwellings. I can't remember what the new pledge is; but most people do remember that so few of those 1966 promises were kept and in a few moments we will be hearing what some of them have to say about it and after that, Mr Heath - we'll be back with you in a moment.

VOICE OVER:

Mr Wilson's promise. Devaluation doesn't mean of course that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in the bank has best devalued.
The fact. Under Labour the value of the pound has fallen from twenty shillings to fifteen shillings and seven pence. Since Mr Wilson came to power this is what he has done to your pound. Going at the same rate 1971 would be like this - fourteen and three, 1972 - thirteen and a penny, 1973 - twelve shillings, 1974 - eleven shillings, 1975 - ten shillings. The ten bob pound. Only your vote can stop him.

Mr Wilson's promise. Over the period of Parliament I believe we can do it. Certainly without any general increase in taxation.

The fact. Labour have piled on extra taxes to the staggering total of three thousand million a year.

GEOFFREY JOHNSON SMITH:

Welcome back. They say that the proof of any pudding is in the eating - well, let us see how people have enjoyed the taste of the last few Labour years. Then we'll end the programme with Mr Heath. But first - how do you feel?

WOMAN:

I think - I dread to think what it'll be like this time next year.

MAN:

There is a terrible tight knot round about everything at the present day.

WOMAN:

[inaudible] any normal working man is allowed to work hard - well there is no point in it - because they don't leave anything to save these days.

MAN:

We have been laid off for two weeks and the government's done nothing about it. They have not done enough for the north-east. We've got the highest unemployment rate in this country.

MAN:

The present Labour government has done really speaking, absolutely nothing for me personally. And I do not think it will ever do anything for me or the people really unless it is really forced to do something.

WOMAN:

Well, I think it is very hard for people like us who are old age pensioners that have saved for the whole of our lives until this times to find that our money and our capital is gradually going down the whole of the time as the cost of living goes up.

WOMAN:

We have nothing. We have to sell everything we've got and we have to live on that.

WOMAN:

The only thing we are long longing for is not to live too old before we use up the capital we've got. But we are going to at the rate of the prices now.

WOMAN:

These politicians - they get in with their promises and they promise this and they promise that - and what do they do?

WOMAN:

Some of them say one thing and then the other says another and when the election is over everything is different from what they said before.

WOMAN:

No - I haven't got a lot of faith in either of the parties.

MAN:

I don't think much of either of them.

WOMAN:

I wouldn't vote for either party. I've got to the stage that I couldn't care less - like them.

EDWARD HEATH:

What you have just been listening to is the mood of this country today. It is disturbed and disturbing but it is not surprising. I can understand why people feel as they do. It would be very hard not to. People feel they have been let down. It is as simple as that. A lot of promises were made. A lot of promises have been broken. Promises about taxation, about jobs, about prices, about homes. Promises, promises, promises. It sounds like the title of a hit show but the only people who are being hit are ourselves. And I am very much afraid we haven't heard the end of the promises. There'll be new ones and they'll sound good. Promises always do. The only trouble is, promises that don't get kept make people cynical. "Oh yes" they'll says "politicians - they'll promise you anything. It is part of the game. Anyhow, they are all as bad as each other. It doesn't matter who you vote for these days, they are all the same." Now, if you feel that way, and a lot of people do, then somehow, somewhere the people you elected to run this country have let you down because there is a difference. We are not all the same. And it does matter because soon you'll be asked to vote and the decision you take will help to decide not just the issues today but the kind of Britain you want to live in tomorrow. If you ask me : why should I vote Conservative? I ought to be able to tell you very simply - because on June the eighteenth you have an equally simple decision to take.

So what is the single most important quality that the Conservative Party stands for ? What is the one essential thing you'll be voting for? Freedom - it is as simple as that. We think your life is your own and you should be free to arrange it as you think fit. You should have the freedom to live in your own house and the government should make it possible for you to do so. You should have the freedom to be better off if you work harder and the government should see to it that you have the incentive of keeping more of the money that you earn. You should have the freedom to spend your money or to save it. You should have the freedom to have more real say in the way the country - your country - is run. In short, you should have the freedom to be an individual and no one individual should have to be like any other. That's what I believe in. That is what every Conservative believes in - the freedom to choose. That is the alternative to a kind of government that just can't keep its fingers out of any pie. In the days ahead you will hear a lot about policies for this and policies for that. There'll be a great deal of jargon and a lot of statistics, I suppose it is inevitable with an election.

But what concerns me more than all the facts and figures are the people of this country. I do not like to see them standing still. I want them to have better opportunities, more opportunities than they have had in the past. Particularly the young people, facing the world of tomorrow. They should have all the opportunity we can give them. Opportunity to achieve things for themselves. And particularly the older people, the people who are alone who can't look after themselves. They should have the help they so much deserve. I believe the people of this country deserve a better life; and that is the only reason that I am in politics, because I believe just that. And if I have one other ambition today it is perhaps to do something to restore the faith people ought to have in the men and women they elect to lead them. I said earlier you'd hear a lot of promises in the next few days. The Labour Party makes you an offer - carry on with Labour, the last five years all over again. I'll promise you one thing, and I will stand by that promise. I promise you that I will do everything in my power to make sure that for all the people in this country tomorrow will be better than today.
