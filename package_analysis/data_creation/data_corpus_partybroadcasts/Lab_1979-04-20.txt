20th April 1979

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Do you remember the last time the Tories said they had all the answers? They said the law would prevent strikes. It didn't. They said the law would settle strikes. It didn't. They said the law would make unions and management get on together. It couldn't. Tory ideas, instead of solving Britain's industrial problems, brought the country to its knees. Now the Tories say the law should be brought in again. So what do you want for the next five years? Confrontation or co-operation?

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

We believe in working together. It's working together that helped us cut inflation from twenty-six percent four years ago to under ten percent now. And by the way it's funny how the Tories forget to mention that for three years of Labour pay policy, the unions kept their wage demands down and helped put the country back on its feet. Co-operation is the key factor in the success of hundreds of companies up and down the country working hand-in-hand. Last winter, we saw what lack of co-operation can mean. Free collective bargaining, in which Mrs Thatcher deeply believes, conflicted head on with the battle against inflation. The result was industrial trouble, and a lot of people suffered in consequence. But now we've found a better way. Working together is the basis of the new agreement that the Labour government has reached with the unions. The main point are these:

ANONYMOUS MAN:

No strike action before all procedures have been exhausted; no strikes on internal union issues before the TUC examine the problem; strike ballots before industrial action; maintenance of essential services and industries during industrial disputes; tighter control of picketing.

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

This new agreement with the unions is one part of Labour's three point programme to keep industrial peace and start off the eighties in the right spirit. As I've said, union reform comes first. Secondly, there's going to be a yearly economic summit. These have been very successful in other countries like Germany. Thirdly, the public pay commission will make sure that people will get fairly paid and it will take account of particular skills or dangers and difficulties of the job. It's a new approach, worked out with the unions and also very welcome to the employers. I'm not saying that there'll never be another industrial dispute; what I am saying is that this will give us a basis for industrial peace, instead of a recipe for industrial chaos. An industrial peace will mean that we can concentrate on keeping prices down and raising output: things that will make everybody better off. Of course the Conservatives say they'll make you better off too - but will they? They hinted in their manifesto that the tax cuts they go on about are going to be paid for by increasing value added tax - tax on the things that you go to buy. A lot of things could cost a lot more under the Tories. How've they paid for their proposed tax cuts? If they were financed entirely by raising value added tax, our calculations show that the current rates would more than double to seventeen and a half percent.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

The Tories say they will put up VAT. Are you prepared to pay for it? A cooker costing a hundred and fifty pounds today would cost just over thirteen pounds more. A shirt costing six pounds ninety nine would cost sixty three p more. A car costing three thousand pounds today would cost two hundred and sixty four pounds more. A saucepan costing four pounds fifty today would cost forty p more. A suite costing three hundred and fifty pounds today would cost thirty pounds seventy eight more. A woman's dress costing fifteen pounds ninety nine would cost another one pound thirty seven p. Women's shoes costing fifteen pounds today would cost another one pound thirty three.

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

It seems funny, doesn't it, that the Tories should complain about inflation because in the Tory manifesto they say they're going to devalue the Common Market's green pound. That sounds very complicated, but let's see just what it would do to the cost of our shopping.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

The Tories will devalue the Common Market pound. Are you prepared to pay for it? Butter would go up by twelve p a pound. Bread would go up by one and a half p a loaf. Beef would rise by seven p a pound. Sugar would go up by three p a pound. Bacon would go up by four p a pound. Cheese would go up by eleven p a pound.

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

Of course it's not just what you pay in the shops that affects how well off you are. It's what you pay in rent and other charges too. Tory policy is to reduce subsidies. Are you prepared to pay for it? The Tories want to reduce school meal subsidies. We reckon that you're going to have to pay ten pence more per meal. The Tories want to reduce housing subsidies. Council rents could go up by two pounds a week, or more. These are the things that affect the family. Prices, the cost of living, rents. They matter to us, and they matter to the country. Savings, jobs and new investment matter too, if there's to be a strong foundation for the future. Let's look at the facts, facts that show Britain is now on the right track.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Labour has got inflation down from twenty six percent to under ten percent in three years. The pound is riding high again - Britain's gold and currency reserves have trebled since Labour came into office. In 1974 a single pension was seven pounds seventy five and now it is nineteen pounds fifty. Married couples receive thirty one pound twenty. We're better off. Living standards rose by six and a half percent last year. Under the last Tory government, Britain lost fifteen million working days a year in strikes, under Labour we have lost only eight million.

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

But what about the Conservatives' promises?

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Remember last time? They promised to cut tax, they promised to cut prices at a stroke, they promised the law would deal with the unions, they promised to make Britain more competitive - these Tory promises had the country on the verge of collapse, and this time they're making the same promises.

SHIRLEY WILLIAMS:

There are still three questions you should ask them before the election. How much would higher value added tax increase the cost of your shopping? What would the Tories cut - health, schools, housing? Would another million people be out of work under the Tories? Three questions: so far, no answers. But we need answers if we're to grasp the opportunities of the 1980s. Answers to how best we reform industrial relations. Answers to how best to keep prices down. Answers to how best to build a strong economy. From the Tories there are no answers. Labour is trying to offer answers to say how we can get change without chaos. The Labour way is the better way.
