3rd April 1992

VOICE:

Do you recognise this European country? Here's a clue. It's got the highest proportion of its population in employment of any major country in Europe. It's a country that has virtually eliminated the problems of strikes. Is this France?

FRENCH MAN:

No [inaudible] it's not France, er here unemployment is er terrible at the moment and strikes - new ones every day.

VOICE:

The European country we're talking about has seen its standard of living rise by a third in the last ten years. In this country they've seen the tax they pay on wages fall to a fifty year low. Is this Germany we're talking about?

GERMAN MAN:

Nein - in Germany the standard of living did not rise, er maybe it stood on the same standard as before but it didn't rise. I'm sure and the taxes taxes went up not down.

VOICE:

In this country inflation is below the European average, so rising prices are no longer a problem. Its share of world trade has grown every year for the last three years. Is this Italy?

ITALIAN MAN:

No, it is not Italy. We have the prices go up too much e too fast and our trade is not growing like that sadly.

VOICE:

In this country they are spending record amounts on their public services. Is it Holland?

DUTCH WOMAN:

No, I think in Holland spending on public services like er education and housing is not keeping up with inflation.

VOICE:

Which country can this be? Can you guess? If you can please ring this number - it's the number of the Labour party's headquarters - because the country we're describing is Britain and Labour don't seem to recognise it.

DOUGLAS HURD:

Through these years the Labour party has constantly run down what Britain has achieved, relished the difficult moments, ignored the successes I suppose that was to be expected. After all, Britain has succeeded because like the rest of the world we've broken away from socialism.

FRENCH MAN:

Oh er Britain has er has changed in the last decade - we admire your country now.

ITALIAN MAN:

I remember for example that er fifteen years ago er the Britain was called er the sick man of Europe, er but now I think that it Britain is one of the leaders.

GERMAN MAN:

I [inaudible] as strong competitor during the next years, they did very well during the last years and I don't think they will stop this doing very well.

DUTCH WOMAN:

You should be proud of what you've done. We respect Britain as today it's wonderful compared with what it used to be.

MICHAEL HESELTINE:

It would be a tragedy if the frustrations and the hardships that the recession has caused, and for some is still causing, if it meant that Britain threw away all the achievements of the last decade. Remember that British living standards have never been so high. Over one million people more were treated in NHS hospitals each year. Over a quarter of a million more students go into higher education than when Labour were in power. More Japanese and American companies invest in Britain than in any other country. In Europe much has been achieved. Remember - remember for one moment, remember all the way from now until polling day the appalling mess the Conservatives got this country out of when we took over from the Labour party in 1979.

VOICE:

Under Labour inflation reached twenty seven percent and prices were going up faster that you could track them. Labour got the economy in such a mess that they actually cut spending on the NHS - the only government in history to do so. National Health Service waiting lists went up by forty-eight percent, or nearly half in real terms. Nurses' pay fell by three percent, doctors' pay by seventeen percent. The health unions were so angry they went on strike, turning away patients from hospitals. The dead went unburied and the rubbish was left in the streets. It was Labour's terrible winter of discontent. But it was Labour's taxes that really crippled Britain. They took away Britain's incentive to work hard. Strikes for more pay to keep up became a way of life for people in Britain. The last thing we need now is for Labour to come in and wreck Britain's recovery.

But Labour says it's time for a change and they've changed and you can trust the Labour party now. Well can we? Can we trust Neil Kinnock, who himself says if values really are values they don't change really? When he was the leader of the hard left he wanted to nationalise everything in sight - major institutions, all the big companies. Now he says we've stopped that nonsense. He used to say he wanted Britain to pull out of Europe, now he says he's all in favour of Europe. Once he was firmly against Scottish devolution, now he says he's always been in favour of devolution. Once he was a leading light of CND and wanted to ban the bomb, now he says he's dropped CND. As you can see Neil Kinnock is so keen to get into Number Ten he keeps changing direction. The more he changes the more people think Neil Kinnock can't be trusted. They can't trust a man who would change any principle, abandon any policy, say anything to get elected. In their effort to get into power Labour have made dozens of promises in their manifesto.

Labour's Michael Meacher made thirteen point six billion pounds worth of promises. Tony Blair has made five billion pounds worth of promises. Robin Cook has made three point two billion pounds worth of promises. Bryan Gould six point three billion pounds worth of promises. John Prescott three point six billion pounds worth of promises. Jack Straw two point six billion pounds worth of promises. Gerald Korfman two point five billion pounds worth of promises. Gordon Brown has made four hundred and sixty million pounds worth of promises. Roy Hattersley managed only two hundred and seventy million pounds worth of promises. So many promises, so many pledges, so many billions of pounds. What they still haven't told you is where is the money coming from - because they suspect you won't like the answer: tax tax and more tax. That's the last thing Britain needs to pull out of the recession.
JOHN MAJOR TALKING HEAD:

I know the recession's been pretty tough for some families. We need to get on with Britain's economic recovery - that's why this election is so important, because Britain needs the confidence only a Conservative government will bring. Confidence to invest, to create more jobs, to get the economy really humming again. Labour would put the recovery into reverse. Their taxes would put families under terrible pressure - extra taxes everybody would have to pay. Millions and millions of families would find it hard to meet their mortgage bills. But that's not all. Imagine the turmoil if our health reforms were uprooted, our trade union reforms undone - upheaval, bureaucracy, an end to industrial peace, that's the kind of mess that Labour offers.

So what do I want for Britain? A Britain where the tax man doesn't punish you for hard work; a Britain where your money holds its value; a Britain where everyone has the right to own their own home; a Britain that offers dignity and security for the old; a Britain where people can pass on what they've built up in their lifetime of work to their children and their grandchildren; a Britain where hospital waiting lists come down and standards in schools go up; a Britain where we help each other giving a hand up not just a hand out; a Britain where people feel safe on our streets and in their homes; a Britain where our inner cities are restored and our countryside cared for; a Britain well defended, proud and respected; a government which hold Britain together, stands up for Britain abroad and doesn't let Brussels walk all over us. There's only one real choice in this election - going forward with me or backwards with Mr Kinnock. Don't mortgage your family and your future to Labour don't let them throw away all that you've achieved. Let's get on with building the best future for Britain together.
