25th April 1979

MAN 1:

Will the Conservatives bring unemployment down? Will they manage to halt the rip-roaring increase in prices? Will they provide the incentives which we all know are necessary to get things moving? Well, we think they will. Obviously Labour thinks they won't. Who's right? Tonight, you've got a chance to decide. I warn you there's not much light relief in this broadcast, but it may help you to make up your mind.

MAN 2:

You are probably bored with all the political experts giving one opinion after another, and all the pundits giving their theories on the nation's future. We thought we'd spare you that for the next few minutes, so here instead in ten minutes you'll get nothing but facts. Not opinions, not view points, but facts. Official government records. First of all, I think we'd all accept that it is the natural and proper desire for everyone to want to do better this year than he did last. This is what causes progress. Nowadays this desire to get on means people want to increase their wages, every year if possible. Wages, as I'm sure we all know, are dependent on production.

MAN 3:

Production. Fact: since Labour came to power five years ago, Britain's total production has increased only half as much as the rest of the world. Fact: Britain is manufacturing less today than five years ago.

MAN 2:

So, if our production has been low under Labour, what has inevitably happened to our wages?

MAN 3:

Wages. Fact: in the last five years the average German worker has seen his wages go up by ninety-two per cent. The French worker's has gone up by sixty per cent. But the British worker's wages have only gone up by sixteen per cent. Fact: Britain now has the lowest hourly wages of any country in the common market, except Ireland.

MAN 2:

But in spite of the fact that our production has gone down, and we produce less wealth, people still want to do better - they always do. So what happens? If no more wealth is being produced the only way one man or group of men can do better is at the expense of another. The result is strikes and chaos, and even less wealth to share out. The strongest and the loudest voices seem to win. Soon everyone gets the hang of this; everyone shouts louder - result? Inflation.

MAN 3:

Inflation. Fact: since Labour came to power Britain has had the worst peace time inflation since the Great Plague, over three hundred years ago. Fact: Since Labour came to power Britain has suffered one of the worst inflation rates of any major industrial country. Fact: the pound buys less than half of what it did five years ago. Fact: Since Labour came to power the price of food has more than doubled.

MAN 2:

And what's the effect of all that inflation? Even more stagnation, and worse still, unemployment. Everyone trying to take more from each other eventually throws people out of work.

MAN 3:

Unemployment. Fact: since Labour came to power, twice as many people have become unemployed. Fact: since Labour came to power, one more person has become unemployed every three minutes thirty five seconds. Fact: for every school leaver unemployed when Labour came to power there are nine today. Fact: every single Labour government has left more people unemployed when it left office.

MAN 2:

And with unemployment at those levels, the tax burden on those who are working inevitably got bigger. And it's not just the rich people who have to pay.

MAN 3:

Tax. Fact: since Labour came to power, the average British family now pays over twice as much tax. Fact: no major industrial country extracts a higher rate of tax from both people with high and low incomes.

MAN 2:

This burden costs so much that there isn't enough to spend on things we all agree we need, like hospitals and schools.

MAN 3:

Hospitals and schools. Fact: since Labour came to power, capital spending on schools has fallen by more than half. Fact: since Labour came to power, capital spending on hospitals has actually decreased.

MAN 2:

A disastrous performance by any standards. But the big question is this: can the Conservatives do any better? It's all very well to point out how badly Labour have done, but how can the Conservatives prove they would do any better? After all, they've been in opposition for the last five years. Well, there's one way to prove it - by looking at the official record of the two parties since the war. Since 1945 the Conservatives and Labour have had about the same length of time in power. Both have had the same chance to fulfil, or break, their promises. What does the record say - and remember, these figures are the official government records? First, as we said earlier, the key is production.

MAN 3:

Production. Fact: since the war, industrial production has gone up twice as much with the Conservatives.

MAN 2:

Now if low production under Labour has meant low wages, what has the higher Conservative production done for wages?

MAN 3:

Wages. Fact: during Conservative periods of government, the average industrial worker's real take home pay has gone up by four and a half times more.

MAN 2:

When production is growing, people can satisfy their natural desire to do better and increase their wages, without inflationary wage demands. We can afford to pay ourselves more, without the chronic inflation we've had over the last few years.

MAN 3:

Inflation. Fact: since the war, there has been half as much inflation with the Conservatives.

MAN 2:

Half as much inflation, twice as much production, and higher wages with the Conservatives, has meant we could buy more and produce more. So there was more work, more jobs.

MAN 3:

Unemployment. Fact: twice since the war, nearly a million new jobs have been created with the Conservatives, something that has never happened under a Labour period of government.

MAN 2:

When production goes up, there's less need for the tax payer to have to spend money propping up industry. So we don't have to pay so much tax.

MAN 3:

Tax. Fact: unlike Labour, every single Conservative government has cut income tax.

MAN 2:

Higher production has also meant that there was more money to pay for the things we all need.

MAN 3:

Hospitals and schools. Fact: spending on the National Health Service has risen, in real terms, faster with the Conservatives. Fact: since the war, nine hundred thousand new school places have been introduced by the Conservatives.

MAN 2:

These are the facts. Not opinions, but official government statistics on Britain's performance over the last few years. It proves that whatever else this election is about - prices, inflation, unions, education - the key is production.

MAN 1:

Somebody once said, 'Why gaze in the crystal ball if you can read the book'. The truth is that more goods are produced under the Conservatives. It's as simple as that. And of course more goods are produced the cash is there to make a practical reality of caring. There are real benefits to be found for the sick and the under privileged, for the young and the old alike. And there are higher wages, and they're matched by lower taxes and real ongoing jobs. So think hard before you vote this time, and make your judgement on the record. Don't just hope for a better life - vote for one.

MAN 4?:

Don't just hope for a better life - vote for one.
