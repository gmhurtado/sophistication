3rd October 1974

VOX POP MAN 1:

I'm all right Jack - it's the same as everybody in this country we're all out to feather our own beds - it it's a cold hard truth, we all want to earn our own money. If that man over there's earning fifty pound a week and I want to take home a hundred and twenty pound - I'm all right Jack

MAN 1:

But are you all right Jack? If you haven't got a strong trade union behind you, digging its heels in, and pushing through a large wage increase for you, the chances are you're anything but all right. So nobody listens to you. And if nobody listens what are they going to do for you? Now we don't think that's right. And that's why a Conservative government is going to introduce a national contract, one with all the people in this country, not with just some of them. On election day, you elect your MP, you expect him to look after the interests of all the people, not just his party. It's the same with the government. It has a contract with all the people. It cannot and must not serve just one section. People have to be protected. Inflation's a killer. It's because we're determined to protect people that we put homes and jobs and pensions slap bang at the top of our list of priorities. Of course we've got to protect the pensioners, and we've already said very clearly what we shall be doing.

MAN 2:

Yes, we're going to do four things for pensioners, and we're going to start doing them straight away. First, we're going to increase pensions twice a year and pay the first increase as from February at the latest. Second. we're going to pay the ten pound Christmas bonus again this year, just as the Conservative government did in each of the last two years. Third. we're going to scrap the earnings rule as soon as we can and start relaxing it straight away. Fourth, we're going to raise the starting point at which people over sixty-five begin to pay tax. Now these four measures really do add up to a new deal for old people.

MAN 1:

So that's straight forward. But it's going to be much harder to protect people's jobs, and that's where these big wage increases don't help at all. They simply feed inflation. They make employers - state, private, it doesn't matter who they are - it makes them say: "Well, if that's what it costs to employ people I can't afford to employ so many of them". So you get unemployment. That's happening now. You've got the ridiculous situation of firms with full order books and they haven't got the cash to pay the wages. So they have to lay people off. So Labour policies are actually causing unemployment, and more nationalisation will only make things worse, and nobody wants it anyhow. But these wage increases are also doing something else that I find very worrying. They're creating new divisions in our society that were never there before. We used to talk, and I'm afraid we still do, about rich and poor, the haves and have-nots, today it's not that simple. There really are a lot of people who have got nobody to protect them. There are millions of them. They've no trade union, they've no voice, and you could be one of them.

VOX POP WOMAN:

Well, I think that we were brought up as working class children.

VOX POP MAN 1:

Yes, certainly.

VOX POP WOMAN:

And we have tried to improve ourselves er educationally, and looked to better things than our parents had, erm and we seem to be penalised for it.

VOX POP MAN 1:

In terms of what was er achieved so far and instead of being able to progress we're held back. I- I - it I think we're typical of a large number of people who want to be independent of of the local authority, want to be independent of large erm Labour unions erm who have found it very difficult to survive over the last erm six months, nine months and it's not a case now of us thinking how our standard of living is going down, it's already gone down, and we've seen that happening, and I think there are lots of young people now who have er to some extent gone out on a limb to buy a house who are finding things very very tight, and the children suffer, erm we don't pursue anything particularly brilliant in terms of a lifestyle but we do feel that there ought to be some reward at the end of the line for people who are prepared to work hard.

VOX POP MAN 2:

Mortgage payments at the moment are very high. I think we're paying here eleven and a quarter percent. If that rate of mortgage interest went up anymore than that frankly I don't quite know what we'd do about it, because eleven and a quarter when we took it out was fine but er with inflation and everything else at the moment if it goes up much higher we could have a big problem.

VOX POP WOMAN 2:

It's not only a question of the mortgage repayments, there's also the rates which at the moment are very high.

MARGARET THATCHER:

Mr and Mrs Maybury were only saying what a lot of people are thinking. Nothing is more important than the security that comes from knowing you've a home of your own. But it's becoming more and more of a problem to get that home. And when you've got it, to meet the costs of running it. We're determined to make it less of a problem. And we've said how. Just let me repeat it. Nine and a half percent mortgages from Christmas. And that's not just for new mortgages, it doesn't matter what rate you're paying now, from Christmas, down it comes to nine and a half percent. And then special cash help for people trying to get a deposit together for their first home. And people who have been council tenants for at least three years will have the right in law to buy their home at two-thirds the market value.

But what if you've started to buy your home, and then find you can't afford the running costs? What about the rates? For many people, what was difficult has become almost impossible. But of course the whole system wasn't really fair to begin with. You can have an old retired couple living next door to a family with two or three wage earners bringing in, say, eight pounds a week , and next door again is a young married couple with small children, just starting out on say forty pounds a week. And yet they all pay the same rates. It's just not fair.

The Conservative government is going to put an end to this, and we're going to make a start straight away. Next year we shall take teachers' salaries off the rates and have them paid by the government. That means there'll be immediate relief. And you'll be able to see the difference in the first rate demand you receive next year. That's just a start. Within the next five years, as soon as we can manage it, we shall get rid of rates all together. The bills will be paid from the ordinary tax system, and that must be a fairer way to do things.

VOX POP MAN 2:

Maybe one man's forty thirty forty percent wage increase is another man's thirty forty percent cost increase, and it's those who have got the power and the might behind them with the unions that certainly seem to be getting the better end of the deal at the moment.

MAN 2:

We've just got to put an end to'them' and 'us'. There's no need for it, there's no time for it. We've got to start working together for all our sakes. The problems we face today are too severe for any one party to solve on its own. That is why we have to get together. That is the only way we have a chance to beat inflation, and avoid another winter of strikes. I don't believe that the trade unions will refuse to work with a government which represents all the people of this country, a democratically elected government. We want a clear majority so that we can form a government of national unity, of all those who put Britain first. That is a firm promise. A week today you cast your vote. Thursday October the tenth. On Monday the fourteenth, we shall be making a start, we shall sit round that table, all of us, and start working together. A national government of all the people - that's what this country needs. And the only way it's going to get it, is to vote Conservative.
