28th April 1997

Synopsis
This broadcast takes the form of a mini-drama. 'Tom' and 'Becky' are father and daughter. They've been at the hospital, where Becky has had to wait for treatment on a broken arm. It's late at night and raining, so they decide to take a taxi home. During the taxi-driver's speech about 'decline' we see images of how another Conservative government would affect Becky's life negatively. When Tom and Becky get out of the taxi, they notice that the taxi driver has a pair of angel's wings and that the clocks have gone back, making it possible for Tom to vote.

TOM:
Can you take us to Elm Road just the other side of the park?

TAXI DRIVER:
Course I can - hop in. You don't want to walk in weather like this. Number twenty six isn't it Becky?

BECKY:
How does he know my name?

TAXI DRIVER:
Terrible weather, terrible times. Did you vote then Tom?

BECKY:
How does he know your name?

TOM:
I meant to, but we've been in casualty all evening.

TAXI DRIVER:
Of course you have. You hurt your arm, didn't you Becky? Hairline fracture. Must hurt though. Still, it'll get better. Shame the health service won't.

TOM:
You're telling me. Six hours we were in casualty.

TAXI DRIVER:
Shortage of equipment or shortage of staff?

TOM:
Both, they said.

TAXI DRIVER:
So much seems to be in decline. I mean you must really worry about the future Tom. Just imagine what your Becky's life will be like if the Tories get back in for another five years. What'll happen the next time she needs to go to the hospital? It doesn't bear thinking about does it? They're pulling the NHS apart bit by bit - barely exist in a few years time. I mean your children are your future Tom, and there's a whole generation who only know about run down schools. That's no good, is it? How's she going to learn in an overcrowded classroom? I tell you it'll be difficult to find a decent school. I mean you've got to be honest with people - all that nonsense about tax - who do the Tories think they're kidding? There's VAT on heating now, although they said they'd never do it. They give with one hand and take with the other. There's twenty-two new taxes - twenty-two! What's next? Food? Kiddies' clothing? Books? If there's something you really need the Tories will Tax it. Ha ha ha eh? Listen to me going on - I sound like a flipping taxi driver. But it's not even safe to walk the streets is it? Violent crime has doubled and things can only get worse you know, because the real trouble makers are getting away with it. And where are all the extra coppers they promised you? No Tom, you've just got to face it - the Tories have let you down. Strange really, `cos that John Major seemed like a nice enough man. Hello, the rain's stopped. It doesn't have to be this way though, does it, eh? I mean the future could be so much brighter. Things can be better. That's why you have to vote.

TOM:
It's too late.

TAXI DRIVER:
Eh, don't worry about that. Have this one on me. Don't you worry either Becky. Take it from me - broken wings soon mend.

TOM:
Where's he gone? Where did you go?

TAXI DRIVER (VOICE OVER):
That's why you have to vote.

TOM:
We're back where we started.

TAXI DRIVER (VOICE OVER):
That's why you have to vote.

TOM:
Never again.

BECKY:
Can we have a pizza?

TOM:
Course we can.

BECKY:
You'll have to cut it up for me.

TOM:
That's what dads are for.

VOICE:
Britain deserves better. Vote Labour this Thursday.
