17th May 1983

VOICE:

Do you remember what it was like before the last election? What it was like at the beginning of 79? The rubbish piled high in the streets, ambulances left unmanned, the dead unburied, cancer patients sent home from hospital. Do you remember what it was like in 1979?

Waiting lists for hospitals had grown by a quarter of a million, pensioners who'd seen their Christmas bonuses cancelled in both 1975 and 76 saw their savings eaten away by inflation. The Labour party promised to improve public services but because the money had run out those services had got worse. Labour had promised to bring down unemployment but unemployment had doubled. They had promised to make Britain prosperous, but under Labour prices had doubled. By May 1979 no-one was prepared to believe in the politics of spend, spend, spend any longer. Do you remember what it was like in 1979?

ANONYMOUS MAN [Outdoors]:

On the third of May the people of Britain voted for a new and completely different style of government. Here's why the change was so necessary.

VOICE:

Every Labour government since the war had put government spending up. As a result every Labour government put the average rate of inflation up, and as a result of that every Labour government put unemployment up.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

The more that Labour governments spent the more inflation went up and the more new problems this in turn created and so the more they needed to put spending up again. It was a vicious circle until the Conservatives promised to reverse the direction, to put a break on government spending to get inflation down so our industries could compete again and so there could be new hope of long term control over unemployment.

VOICE:

How have the Conservatives done? They have been the first government since the war to deliberately aim to spend less, not more. They've been the first government for a quarter of a century to bring the average rate of inflation down. Inflation now is the lowest it's been for fifteen years, and the Conservatives have been the first government to truly understand that if our goods aren't priced right they don't sell, and if they don't sell jobs are lost.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

The master key is inflation. The first years were difficult years. The government had acknowledged that things would be tough before they could get better. But as the policies of controlling government spending and bringing down inflation begin to take effect so the break can begin to appear in the clouds of unemployment. This is still the biggest challenge facing us in Britain but we need to see the problem in perspective.

VOICE:

Last year unemployment rose by thirty four percent in West Germany, by twenty three percent in the United States, by ten percent in Japan, but only six percent in Britain. Industry is beginning to breathe again and as it begins to recover so old jobs are beginning to be secured and new jobs are being created.

ANONYMOUS MAN:

Despite one of the worst recessions the western world has seen there is new hope in Britain and new confidence in the future. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

VOICE:

Under the Conservatives exports are up to record levels, pensions are up by five percent ahead of inflation, there are five thousand more doctors in the National Health Service and four hundred and forty five thousand more nurses and midwives. The number of police is up by over nine thousand, home ownership is up to three families out of five, productivity is up to record levels and the standard of living is up. But now look what's down with the Conservatives: income tax, mortgage rates, inflation to the lowest level for fifteen years, interest rates, government borrowing is down to one of the lowest figures in western Europe, hospital queues are down, strikes are down.

CECIL PARKINSON:

Four years ago this government accepted a task that appeared almost impossible. Our country had been slowly declining for years. To reverse this decline was not something that could be accomplished easily. It required courage and perseverance, but we are now beginning to see the first fruits. British industry is confirming that the recovery is under way. Britain has been coming out of the world recession even faster than France or Germany. The country has a new self confidence. Britain's on the right track. On June the ninth it will be your decision, your vote that will decide whether to continue forward with this totally different style of government or to go back to the old ways of doing things. Let's not go back, let's not throw away the last four years, let's keep going forward.

VOICE:

Britain's on the right track. Don't turn back.
